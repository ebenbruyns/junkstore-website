Title: Early R&D release: New diagnostics framework for Junk Store 2.0

Body:
Unusual for us to release early R&D work, but this diagnostics tool is already proving useful.

**What it does:**
- Automatically detects Steam Deck issues
- Suggests remedies
- Acts as emergency escape hatch when SteamOS updates break functionality
- Checks disk space, critical files, Flatpak status, etc.

Available on beta channel. Enable through developer mode in System settings.

Still early development but functional. Thoughts on having diagnostic tools built into gaming software?
