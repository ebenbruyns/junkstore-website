**üöÄ New in Junk Store 2.0.8:** Batch Game Install System revolutionizes how you set up your Steam Deck gaming library.

## What's New

The new Batch Install System allows you to queue multiple games from Epic Games Store, GOG, and Amazon Games for simultaneous installation - no more installing games one by one!

## Why We Built This

### The Old Way (Painful)
Before this update, setting up a new Steam Deck meant:
1. Install one game ‚Üí wait 20-60 minutes
2. Install next game ‚Üí wait another 20-60 minutes  
3. Repeat 10+ times
4. Total setup time: **4-8 hours of active monitoring**

### The New Way (Effortless)
With Batch Install System:
1. Select all desired games (checkboxes)
2. Click "Install Selected" 
3. Walk away
4. Total setup time: **15 minutes of active work**

## How It Works

### Smart Queue Management
<div class="game-entry">
  <div class="game-details">
    <strong>Intelligent Prioritization</strong>
    <div class="compatibility-info">
      <div class="compatibility-line">üèÜ High-priority games install first</div>
      <div class="compatibility-line">üìè Smaller games download before larger ones</div>
      <div class="compatibility-line">üîÑ Failed downloads automatically retry</div>
      <div class="compatibility-line">‚è∏Ô∏è Pause/resume individual or all installations</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Bandwidth Intelligence
The system automatically manages download speeds to prevent overwhelming your connection:
- **Multiple small games**: Full parallel downloading
- **Large games**: Staggered installation to prevent timeouts
- **Network detection**: Automatically adjusts based on connection quality

### Progress Tracking
Real-time visibility into all installations:
- Overall progress percentage
- Individual game download status
- Estimated completion times
- Storage space monitoring

## Perfect Use Cases

### 1. New Steam Deck Setup
Just got a new Steam Deck? Queue up your entire Epic Games library:
- Select 20+ free Epic games you've claimed
- Add essential GOG classics  
- Include Amazon Prime gaming titles
- Let it run overnight

### 2. After Major Updates
When SteamOS updates break Proton compatibility:
- Batch reinstall affected games
- Test multiple titles simultaneously  
- Restore your library quickly

### 3. Seasonal Gaming Prep
Before a long trip or gaming weekend:
- Install multiple games for variety
- Download different genres for mood matching
- Prepare offline gaming library

## Technical Implementation

### Under the Hood
- **Multi-threaded downloads**: Utilizes all available CPU cores
- **Checksum verification**: Ensures download integrity
- **Atomic operations**: Partial downloads don't corrupt installations
