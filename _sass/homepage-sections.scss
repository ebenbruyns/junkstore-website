   HOMEPAGE SECTIONS LEGACY FILE

/* IMPORTANT: This file has been restructured for better maintainability */
/* All styles have been moved to page-specific CSS files: */

/* Homepage styles → homepage-specific.scss (scoped to .layout--splash) */
/* Blog styles → blog-specific.scss (scoped to .layout--single/.layout--blog) */
/* Other pages → other-pages-specific.scss (FAQ, comparison, about, etc.) */
/* Site-wide styles → base-styles.scss (navigation, TOC, code blocks, etc.) */

/* This approach prevents broad selectors from affecting multiple page types */
/* and makes CSS maintenance much easier and more predictable. */

/* The original content is preserved in homepage-sections-backup.scss for reference */
