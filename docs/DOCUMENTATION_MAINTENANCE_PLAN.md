# Documentation Maintenance Plan
**Generated:** July 29, 2025  
**Owner:** Project Coordination Master  
**Review Schedule:** Weekly updates, monthly comprehensive audit

## Problem Statement

The user identified that documentation files were not being maintained with current project context, creating disconnection between actual work and documented progress. This plan establishes systematic documentation maintenance to ensure all project files reflect current reality.

## Ownership and Responsibility Matrix

- `/CLAUDE.md` (project instructions)
- `/POST_CHANGE_COORDINATION_PROTOCOL.md`

**Responsibility:** Strategic documentation, master plans, coordination protocols
**Update Schedule:** Weekly or after major project phases
**Quality Standard:** Must reflect current project priorities and recent achievements

#### 2. **Content & Brand Consistency Agent**
**Owns:**
- All agent files: `/claude-agents/*.md`
- Brand and messaging documentation
- FAQ and tutorial content documentation
- Content strategy documents in `/docs-organized/`

**Responsibility:** Agent instructions accuracy, content consistency documentation
**Update Schedule:** After any agent instruction changes or major content updates
**Quality Standard:** Agent files must contain current project context and recent work

#### 3. **QA Procedures Agent**
**Owns:**
- Build and deployment documentation
- Safety protocols and checklists
- Technical change logs
- Performance baseline documentation

**Responsibility:** Technical safety and build process documentation
**Update Schedule:** After any technical changes or safety protocol updates
**Quality Standard:** Must include current build requirements and safety checks

#### 4. **Performance Optimization Agent**
**Owns:**
- Performance baselines and metrics
- Optimization technique documentation
- Site speed and efficiency reports
- Technical performance tracking

**Responsibility:** Performance documentation accuracy and metric tracking
**Update Schedule:** Monthly performance reviews and after optimization work
**Quality Standard:** Must include current baselines and optimization achievements

## Documentation Categories and Maintenance Requirements

### Category 1: CRITICAL (Must Be Current)
**Files:**
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions and context
- `/docs/SITE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` - Current site assessment
- `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Active project roadmap
- All agent files in `/claude-agents/` - Agent instructions and current priorities

**Update Trigger:** Any major project phase completion, strategy changes, or new priorities
**Max Age:** 1 week outdated maximum
**Verification:** Must include references to recent work and current priorities

### Category 2: IMPORTANT (Should Be Current)
**Files:**
- `/docs/TUTORIAL_STRATEGY_REPORT.md` - Tutorial and video strategy
- Progress tracking files in `/docs-organized/project-management/`
- Performance baseline documentation
- Brand style guides and messaging documentation

**Update Trigger:** Monthly review cycle or major feature implementations
**Max Age:** 1 month outdated maximum
**Verification:** Should align with current project direction and completed work

### Category 3: REFERENCE (Can Be Historical)
**Files:**
- Lessons learned documentation
- Historical baselines and comparisons
- Archived reports and analysis
- Technical architecture patterns

**Update Trigger:** Quarterly review or when referenced information becomes inaccurate
**Max Age:** 3 months outdated acceptable
**Verification:** Must be clearly dated and context-appropriate

## Maintenance Protocols

### Daily Maintenance (Automated Where Possible)
- [ ] Verify critical documentation reflects current priorities
- [ ] Update TodoWrite tracking files with completed tasks
- [ ] Ensure agent instruction files include current work context
- [ ] Check for broken internal documentation links

### Weekly Maintenance (Manual Review Required)
- [ ] **Monday:** Review and update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with current week priorities
- [ ] **Wednesday:** Mid-week check of agent instruction accuracy
- [ ] **Friday:** Update SITE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md with completed work and new findings
- [ ] **Weekly:** Audit docs-organized folder for outdated or conflicting information

### Monthly Maintenance (Comprehensive Review)
- [ ] **Week 1:** Complete agent instruction file audit and updates
- [ ] **Week 2:** Performance documentation and baseline review
- [ ] **Week 3:** Strategic documentation alignment check
- [ ] **Week 4:** Archive outdated files and clean up documentation structure

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Before Any Documentation Update
- [ ] Read current file content completely
- [ ] Verify information accuracy against recent project work
- [ ] Check for consistency with other related documentation
- [ ] Ensure proper dating and attribution
- [ ] Validate internal links and references

### After Documentation Updates
- [ ] Verify Jekyll build still functions (for any structural changes)
- [ ] Test internal documentation links
- [ ] Confirm mobile readability (if user-facing)
- [ ] Update cross-references in related documents
- [ ] Notify relevant agents of documentation changes

## Automation Opportunities

### Automated Status Tracking
**Implementation Priority:** High
**Tools:** Simple scripts to track file modification dates and flag outdated documents
**Target:** Weekly automated reports of documentation health

### Cross-Reference Validation
**Implementation Priority:** Medium  
**Tools:** Script to check internal links between documentation files
**Target:** Monthly automated link checking and validation

### Template Standardization
**Implementation Priority:** Medium
**Tools:** Standard templates for reports, agent instructions, and project documentation
**Target:** Consistent formatting and required sections across all documentation

## Emergency Documentation Recovery

### If Documentation Becomes Severely Outdated
1. **Immediate Assessment:** Identify which documents are critical for current work
2. **Rapid Recovery:** Focus on updating critical category documents first
3. **Agent Reactivation:** Ensure all agent instruction files reflect current project state
4. **Cross-Reference Repair:** Fix broken internal documentation links
5. **Quality Verification:** Test all updated documentation for accuracy and consistency

### Documentation Loss Prevention
- **Version Control:** Ensure all critical documents are version controlled
- **Regular Backups:** Monthly snapshots of entire documentation structure  
- **Redundant Storage:** Critical instructions stored in multiple locations
- **Recovery Scripts:** Automated tools to restore documentation from templates

## Success Metrics

### Documentation Health Indicators
- **Currency Score:** Percentage of critical documents updated within required timeframes
- **Accuracy Score:** Consistency between documented and actual project status
- **Accessibility Score:** Ease of finding relevant information when needed
- **Utility Score:** Documentation actually being used for decision-making and guidance

### Monthly Assessment Criteria
- [ ] All agent instruction files reflect current project context
- [ ] Strategic documents align with actual project priorities
- [ ] Technical documentation matches current build and deployment state
- [ ] Performance documentation includes recent baselines and achievements
- [ ] No broken internal links or references to non-existent files
