# Comprehensive Risk Assessment Framework

## Purpose
This document provides a systematic risk assessment framework for both technical website changes and strategic business risks. It covers build-breaking prevention and competitive/market positioning risks based on 2025 strategic analysis.

## Strategic Context (Updated July 28, 2025)
Based on comprehensive competitive research, Junk Store operates in a competitive landscape with significant market positioning risks alongside technical implementation risks. All website changes must consider both technical stability and strategic messaging consistency.

## Technical Risk Categories

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL RISK (Never Touch Without Extreme Caution)

#### Files:
- `/assets/css/main.scss` - Primary CSS entry point
- `/_sass/minimal-mistakes.scss` - Master theme file
- `/_config.yml` - Jekyll configuration
- `/Gemfile` - Dependency management
- `/_sass/minimal-mistakes/` directory - Core theme files

#### Operations:
- Deleting any imported SCSS file
- Modifying import statements
- Changing theme configuration
- Bulk file deletions
- Git operations that affect multiple files

#### Impact if Broken:
- Complete site build failure
- Total styling loss
- Site becomes unusable
- Requires expert intervention to fix

#### Required Process:
- Full backup before ANY change
- Changes only by experienced developers
- Comprehensive testing on staging environment
- Multiple reviewer approval
- Staged rollout plan

### ðŸŸ¡ HIGH RISK (Requires Careful Testing)

#### Files:
- Custom component SCSS files imported in main chain:
  - `buttons.scss`
  - `content-boxes.scss`  
  - `faq-box.scss`
  - `gallery.scss`
  - `tested-games.scss`
  - `troubleshooting-box.scss`

#### Required Process:
- Standard QA procedures (see QA_PROCEDURES.md)
- Visual testing across multiple pages
- Mobile responsiveness verification
- Cross-browser testing

### ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM RISK (Standard Testing Required)

#### Files:
- Component SCSS files not in main import chain:
  - `compatibility-table.scss`
  - `games-table.scss`
  - `homepage-sections.scss`
  - `pricing-section.scss`

#### Operations:
- Adding new CSS rules
- Modifying existing styles
- Creating new SCSS files
- Image optimizations
- Content updates

#### Impact if Broken:
- Individual features may not work
- Visual inconsistencies on specific pages
- Performance issues

#### Required Process:
- Basic build testing
- Spot check affected pages
- Performance verification

### âš« LOW RISK (Minimal Testing Required)

#### Files:
- `/_sass/_site/` directory (backup files)
- Non-imported SCSS files
- Documentation files
- Image files (after optimization)
- Data files (YAML)

#### Operations:
- Content updates
- Documentation changes
- Adding new images (optimized)
- Data file updates
- Cleanup of unused files

#### Impact if Broken:
- Minor content issues
- Documentation inconsistencies
- No impact on site functionality

#### Required Process:
- Basic build verification
- Spot check content accuracy

## Dependency Risk Map

### Critical Import Chain:
```
main.scss
â”œâ”€â”€ minimal-mistakes/skins/default.scss (theme skin)
â”œâ”€â”€ minimal-mistakes.scss (master)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ minimal-mistakes/variables.scss
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ minimal-mistakes/mixins.scss
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ minimal-mistakes/base.scss
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [19 other core theme files]
â”œâ”€â”€ tested-games.scss
â”œâ”€â”€ faq-box.scss
â”œâ”€â”€ troubleshooting-box.scss
â”œâ”€â”€ content-boxes.scss
â”œâ”€â”€ buttons.scss
â””â”€â”€ gallery.scss
```

### NEVER DELETE Files in Import Chain:
- Any file imported directly in `main.scss`
- Any file imported in `minimal-mistakes.scss`
- Any theme core files
- Any files with multiple dependencies

### Safe to Modify/Delete:
- Files in `/_sass/_site/` (backup directory)
- Unused SCSS files not imported anywhere
- Temporary files
- Files without dependencies

## Risk Assessment Questions

Before making ANY change, ask:

### 1. File Impact Analysis:
- [ ] Is this file imported by another SCSS file?
- [ ] Does this file contain variables used elsewhere?
- [ ] Is this file part of the core theme?
- [ ] How many other files depend on this?

### 2. Change Scope Analysis:
- [ ] Am I deleting or renaming files?
- [ ] Am I changing import statements?
- [ ] Am I modifying variables or mixins?
- [ ] Will this affect multiple pages?

### 3. Testing Capability:
- [ ] Can I test this change locally?
- [ ] Do I have a rollback plan?
- [ ] Can I verify the fix before deploying?
- [ ] Do I understand what might break?

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### For Critical Risk Changes:
1. **Staging Environment**: Test on exact copy first
