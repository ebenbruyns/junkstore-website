## Competitive Messaging Framework

### Against Heroic Games Launcher (Most Popular Free Alternative)
**Their Strengths:** Free, Epic + GOG + Amazon support, active community
**Their Weakness:** Requires Desktop Mode switching, manual Steam shortcut creation
**Our Advantage:** "While Heroic requires Desktop Mode for game management, Junk Store keeps everything in Game Mode"

### Against Lutris (Power User Solution)
**Their Strengths:** Comprehensive platform support, Linux gaming focus
**Their Weakness:** Complex setup, steep learning curve, Desktop Mode dependency
**Our Advantage:** "Skip the complexity - Junk Store works immediately without technical knowledge"

### Against NonSteamLaunchers (Automation-Focused)
**Their Strengths:** One-script installation, multiple launcher support
**Their Weakness:** Installs Windows launchers, recently removed from Decky store
**Our Advantage:** "Native Linux integration without Windows launcher overhead"

### Key Phrases to Emphasize vs Competitors
- "Pure Game Mode experience" (no competitor offers this)
- "Zero Desktop Mode switching" (universal pain point with alternatives)
- "Native Steam integration" (games appear exactly like Steam games)
- "One-click installation" (vs complex multi-step setups)
- "Just works" (vs troubleshooting required)
- "Steam Deck optimized" (vs generic solutions)

### Phrases to Avoid
- Generic gaming terms that competitors also use
- Technical jargon without Steam Deck context
- Direct negative comparisons (stay positive)
- Features that don't differentiate us
