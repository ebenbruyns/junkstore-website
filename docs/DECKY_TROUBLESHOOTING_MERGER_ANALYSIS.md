# Decky Troubleshooting Pages Merger Analysis
**Report Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation Tomorrow

## Executive Summary

The Decky troubleshooting content is currently scattered across **4 separate pages** with significant redundancy and inconsistent organization. Merging these into a single, well-organized troubleshooting page (similar to our successful FAQ merger) will improve user experience, reduce maintenance overhead, and create better SEO performance.

## Current Structure Analysis

### Existing Pages
1. **`/troubleshooting/plugin/`** - General plugin troubleshooting (17 questions)
2. **`/troubleshooting/epic/`** - Epic Games specific issues (13 questions) 
3. **`/troubleshooting/gog/`** - GOG extension issues (3 questions)
4. **`/help/deckyhelp/`** - Hub page with links to all resources

### Content Distribution
- **Plugin page:** 17 troubleshooting items (most comprehensive)
- **Epic page:** 13 Epic-specific items (detailed and well-organized)
- **GOG page:** 3 basic items (minimal content)
- **Help hub:** Navigation links only (no troubleshooting content)

## Redundancy Analysis

### Direct Duplicates Found
1. **"Having issues bringing up the keyboard in Game Mode?"**  
   - Appears identically in: `plugin.md:131-144`, `epic.md:161-174`, `gog.md:41-51`
   - **Action:** Keep one instance, remove duplicates

2. **"No games are showing" / "I don't see any games"**  
   - Plugin version: `plugin.md:93-100` (Epic-focused)
   - Epic version: `epic.md:77-90` (more detailed)
   - GOG version: `gog.md:25-38` (GOG-specific)
   - **Action:** Merge into platform-specific sections

3. **Common troubleshooting patterns**
   - Reboot device recommendations
   - Refresh games list instructions
   - Account logout/login steps
