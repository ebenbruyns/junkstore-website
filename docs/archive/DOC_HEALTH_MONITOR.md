# Documentation Health Monitoring System
**Created**: 2025-07-28  
**Purpose**: Automated monitoring and maintenance of documentation quality  
**Status**: Active Monitoring Framework

## System Overview

This monitoring system continuously checks documentation health to prevent the inconsistencies and gaps that led to recent confusion. It provides real-time visibility into documentation quality and automatically maintains freshness and accuracy.

## 🎯 Health Monitoring Framework

### Core Health Metrics

**Documentation Freshness Score (0-100)**
```
Freshness = Σ(Document_Age_Weight × Content_Relevance × Update_Frequency) / Total_Documents

Critical Documents (Weight: 1.0):
- PROJECT_STATE_TRACKER.md (must be current)
- PROGRESS.md (weekly updates required)
- ROADMAP.md (milestone-triggered updates)
- CURRENT_BASELINE.md (build-triggered updates)

Important Documents (Weight: 0.7):
- DECISIONS.md (decision-triggered updates)
- ISSUES.md (issue-triggered updates)
- MAINTENANCE.md (quarterly reviews)

Reference Documents (Weight: 0.5):
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md (phase-triggered updates)
- COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md (major change updates)
```

**Cross-Reference Integrity Score (0-100)**
```
Integrity = (Valid_Links / Total_Links) × (Consistent_References / Total_References) × 100

Checks:
- Internal document links work
- Section references exist
- File paths are accurate
- Status references match reality
- Metrics are consistent across documents
```

**Content Consistency Score (0-100)**
```
Consistency = (Matching_Status_Reports / Total_Status_Items) × (Aligned_Metrics / Total_Metrics) × 100

Verification Points:
- Progress percentages match across docs
- Performance metrics align
- Task status consistency
- Timeline accuracy
- Achievement tracking alignment
```

### Overall Health Score Calculation
```
Overall Health = (Freshness × 0.4) + (Integrity × 0.3) + (Consistency × 0.3)

🟢 90-100: Excellent (no action needed)
🟡 75-89:  Good (minor maintenance)
🟠 60-74:  Fair (attention required)
🔴 0-59:   Poor (immediate action needed)
```

## 🔍 Automated Health Checks

### Daily Verification System

**Freshness Monitoring:**
```bash
# Daily health check routine
for doc in docs/project-management/*.md; do
    last_modified=$(stat -c %Y "$doc")
    current_time=$(date +%s)
    age_days=$(( (current_time - last_modified) / 86400 ))
    
    case "$doc" in
        *STATE_TRACKER*) max_age=1 ;;  # Must be updated daily
        *PROGRESS*)      max_age=7 ;;  # Weekly updates
        *ROADMAP*)       max_age=14 ;; # Bi-weekly review
        *)               max_age=30 ;; # Monthly review
    esac
    
    if [ $age_days -gt $max_age ]; then
        echo "⚠️ $doc is $age_days days old (max: $max_age)"
    fi
done
```

**Content Validation:**
```yaml
# Health check definitions
health_checks:
  freshness:
    critical_docs:
      - file: PROJECT_STATE_TRACKER.md
        max_age_hours: 24
        required_sections: ["Current State Summary", "Build Health", "Git Status"]
      - file: PROGRESS.md
        max_age_days: 7
        required_updates: ["Current Sprint", "Completed Work"]
    
  integrity:
    link_validation:
      - check_internal_links: true
      - validate_file_references: true
      - verify_section_anchors: true
    
  consistency:
    metric_alignment:
      - progress_percentages: true
      - performance_numbers: true
      - task_completion_status: true
```

### Real-Time Issue Detection

**Automatic Problem Identification:**

1. **Stale Documentation**
   ```
   Issue: PROJECT_STATE_TRACKER.md last updated 3 days ago
   Impact: Current project status unknown
   Action: Auto-generate status update from git/build logs
   ```

2. **Broken References**
   ```
   Issue: DECISIONS.md references non-existent section in ROADMAP.md
   Impact: Decision context incomplete
   Action: Fix reference or flag for manual review
   ```

3. **Metric Inconsistencies**
   ```
   Issue: PROGRESS.md shows 21.4MB savings, ROADMAP.md shows 20.1MB
   Impact: Unclear achievement status
   Action: Sync metrics from authoritative source
   ```

4. **Missing Context**
   ```
   Issue: New decisions recorded without sufficient background
   Impact: Future reference value degraded
   Action: Trigger context enhancement workflow
   ```

## 🔧 Automated Maintenance System

### Self-Healing Documentation

**Automatic Fixes:**

1. **Date Stamp Updates**
   ```bash
   # Auto-update "Last Updated" timestamps
   sed -i "s/Last Updated: .*/Last Updated: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)/" docs/project-management/*.md
   ```

2. **Status Synchronization**
   ```python
   # Sync progress status across documents
   def sync_task_status():
       master_status = parse_progress_md()
       for doc in ['ROADMAP.md', 'PROJECT_STATE_TRACKER.md']:
           update_task_status(doc, master_status)
   ```

3. **Metric Alignment**
   ```python
   # Ensure consistent metrics across all docs
   def align_performance_metrics():
       baseline = get_current_baseline()
       for doc in documentation_files:
           update_metrics(doc, baseline)
   ```

4. **Link Validation & Repair**
   ```python
   # Fix broken internal references
   def repair_links():
       for doc in docs:
           broken_links = find_broken_links(doc)
           for link in broken_links:
               fixed_link = resolve_link(link)
               replace_link(doc, link, fixed_link)
   ```

### Intelligent Content Updates

**Context-Aware Maintenance:**

1. **Progress Tracking Automation**
   ```python
   # Auto-update progress based on git commits
   def update_progress_from_commits():
       recent_commits = get_commits_since_last_update()
       for commit in recent_commits:
           task_completion = extract_task_completion(commit)
           update_progress_md(task_completion)
   ```

2. **Decision Impact Tracking**
   ```python
   # Measure and record decision outcomes
   def track_decision_outcomes():
       for decision in recent_decisions:
           performance_impact = measure_performance_change(decision.date)
           user_satisfaction = analyze_feedback(decision.date)
           update_decision_outcomes(decision.id, performance_impact, user_satisfaction)
   ```

3. **Roadmap Progress Sync**
   ```python
   # Update roadmap based on actual completion
   def sync_roadmap_progress():
       completed_tasks = get_completed_tasks()
       for task in completed_tasks:
           update_roadmap_status(task.phase, task.item, "completed")
   ```
