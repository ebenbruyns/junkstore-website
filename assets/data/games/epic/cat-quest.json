  "description": "Cat Quest is a 2D open world RPG with the exploration of Skyrim, but set in the visual style of an overworld. This is a fantasy world that asks the question of how different it would be if cats lived in it instead of humans!\nGo to places like the Catpital where the Lion King rules, or experience delicacies like the catnip pie! Talk to the locals, some already on their 7th or 8th lives(what? not all cats have nine lives y'know), and go on a catventure through a world you've never seen before!",
