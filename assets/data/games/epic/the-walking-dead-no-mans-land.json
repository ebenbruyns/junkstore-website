  "description": "Join Rick, Daryl, Michonne and other iconic characters from AMC's The Walking Dead in the official mobile game of the show. Do you have what it takes to stay alive?\n\nThe Walking Dead: No Man's Land is a thrilling, action-packed RPG where tactical choices make the difference between life and death. Only the strongest will survive so choose your team wisely: bring Michonne and dominate in close-quarter combat or send Rick to dispatch enemies from afar. Or perhaps you'll choose to snipe from a distance with Daryl's crossbow, or mow the herd down with Abraham's assault rifle.",
