  "description": "Wolfenstein: The New Order is an action-adventure shooter game played from a first-person perspective. It is the semi-sequel to 2009's Wolfenstein, however utilizes very little from the game and drops any direct references to veil or supernatural.\n\nTo progress through the story, the player battle enemies throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, the player must use a health pack to replenish the missing health. In combat, a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. The player have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which can be used as a tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives the player a wide variety of weapon optionsâ€”they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around.",
