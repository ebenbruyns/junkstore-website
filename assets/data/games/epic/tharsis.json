It puts you in control of humanity's first manned mission to Mars, just as it's struck by a micrometeoroid storm. You must guide your crew through disasters, food shortages, and the unforgiving nature of space - all while maintaining your sanity amidst cryptic signals and warnings from Mars.\nDefy the odds, make the difficult decisions, and embark on the most important mission in human history.",
