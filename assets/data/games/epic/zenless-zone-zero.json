Build a squad of up to three and begin your assault with Basic and Special Attacks. Dodge and Parry to neutralize your opponents' counterattacks, and when they're Stunned, unleash a powerful combo of Chain Attacks to finish them off! Remember, different opponents have different traits, and it would be prudent to use their weaknesses to your advantage.",
