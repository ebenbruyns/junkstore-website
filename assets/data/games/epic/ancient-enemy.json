  "description": "An unusual, strategic RPG card game from the makers of Shadowhand and Regency Solitaire.\n\n\"Awakening from centuries of slumber, a fallen mage returns to battle twisted folkloric foe across sprawling, ghostly landscapes. His ultimate destination: the nameless antagonist, a dread nemesis waiting patiently in the dark fastness of monstrous citadel, his Ancient Enemy.\n\nYou'll embark upon a quest inspired by British mythology and Mabinogion, so expect card battling, visceral fights, mixed with bleak and evocative folklore! Loot the fallen to fill your hero's RPG-style inventory with collectible cards, capture strongholds and gather talented henchmen. Only powerful magic and iron determination will enable revenge upon your ultimate foe.\"",
