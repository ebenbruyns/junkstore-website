  "notes": "There are a few steps to get this working in game mode. Best is to do this all in desktop/Big Picure mode through Junk Store before hopping back into Game mode. Tested with Proton Experimental.<br> - First download the game in Junk Store then launch the game once to set a prefix<br> - You then need to install  the pdh dependency, I used Protontricks from desktop mode<br> - Once the depedency is installed, go back into Big Picture mode and before launching the game set the exe to <strong>./Crystal of Atlan.exe</strong> (remember to push X to save) then launch the game.<br> - This next part took me a few goes. The game may load to a black screen and seem stuck, just be patient as it's loading and you'll see the game splash screen eventually.<br> - Once the game loads and says <em>Click anywhere to proceed</em> do that and then you need to wait for an age verification box to open. This is what didn't always load properly, you get a white screen and may need to move the mouse around for it to show. Once you click confirm for age verification the game should load and you can play.<br> - Once you get to playing the game in desktop/big picture mode it should now load without issue in game mode. It seems to have full controller support too.",
