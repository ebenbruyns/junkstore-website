  "description": "Dungeon of the Endless - Definitive Edition\n\nDungeon of the Endless is Amplitude Studios’ take on the demanding Roguelike genre, mixing in Dungeon-Defense mechanics for a unique gameplay experience.\nCondemned to slave labor in the Auriga system as punishment for a life of crime, your situation goes from bad to worse when you crash land in a mazelike Endless facility on an unknown planet.\nYour only goal is to survive and get out of there. For that you’ll need a team: inmates, guards, and any survivors have the potential to become great allies.\nExplore the facility and unearth life-saving technologies. Your teammates will also need some gear to unleash their true potential and earn powerful abilities. And don’t forget to gather Dust! Without it, you’ll be stuck in the dark.\nWith monsters at your heels and a merry band of misfits for a team, get ready for a bumpy ride with the Definitive Edition which, along with the base game, includes:\n\nDungeon of the Endless - Deep Freeze\n\nThe “Refreezerator” spaceship will let you experience the game in a different way as well as introduce a new teammate: Kreyang. Don’t touch anything related to Drakken history in her presence… you might lose a hand.\n\nDungeon of the Endless - Rescue Team\n\nYou’ve crashed somewhere in an uncharted part of the galaxy? No one is responding to your cries for help? Fear not, the Rescue Team is on its way! For drill sergeant Sasha, operator Zugma and… Audio engineer Wes, failure is not an option.",
