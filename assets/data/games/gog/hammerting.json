  "description": "Hammerting is a vertical dwarven mining colony sim with RPG elements.\n\nManage a clan of colorful dwarves, establish an epic mining operation, craft legendary swords and delve deep for greater glory, riches... and danger.\n\nWith a war raging on the surface, the dwarves pledge to delve deep and, as the master craftspeople they are, produce and supply whatever is needed. From humble beginnings, you start with a few, hurried dwarves who need to set up operations. Ultimately, your small clan of dwarves will be known throughout the Upper Realms for their skill, and the base will span kilometers.",
