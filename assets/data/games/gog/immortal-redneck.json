Also, you can get new skills in the scrolls that you’ll find in the dungeons… And buy new ones in the skill tree!\n\nEach time you play, the game will be DIFFERENT! Procedural dungeons filled with bad monsters wait for you to enter and discover the secrets of the Ancient Pyramids of Egypt.\n\nBlood, bullets, evil monsters, big bosses and a ton of fun: Take your gun and let the craziness begin!\"",
