  "description": "A swashbuckling adventure!\nEn Garde! is a swashbuckling action-adventure game set in 17th century's Spain. Play as Adalia de Volador, a noble & impetuous swordswoman! Your palace has been seized by a mysterious mastermind and his hoard of guards - you will have to defend your family's honor!\n\nFight with your rapier and acrobatic moves against numerous opponents, and use the environment to your advantage in an intuitive way (every object is interactive, from tables to chandeliers!). You can even use your sense of repartee to taunt your opponents. Combat is a spectacle and should be done with panache!\n\nThis En Garde! prototype features story-driven action in an open level (the Volador's Palace) for a total play time of about 30 minutes.",
