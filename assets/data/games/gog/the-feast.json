  "description": "The Feast is a short and intensely dramatic experience designed to be completed in one sitting (20-30 minutes).\n\nThis dark and peculiar spectacle grants you the lead role. In a theatrical setting, survive the utterly confusing and twisted dinner. You will be observed and judged, so face reality, weigh every action, consider possible outcomes, make choices - and define the conclusion of this life-changing celebration.\n\nAfter all, what happens here is not your problem…\n… or is it?",
