  "description": "Forager is the popular crafting, exploration and base building game that can best be defined as “the idle game that you want to actively keep playing”.\n\nA quirky mix between old school 2D Zelda experiences and modern Minecraft or Terraria-like crafting games that places players into a small piece of land with just a pickaxe and a desire for expansion and exploration.\n\nPlayers can buy procedurally generated lands to uncover secrets, solve puzzles, find dungeons, treasure and forgotten relics and to expand their sprawling bases. Nearly impossible to put down, there is always something to manage or work towards!",
