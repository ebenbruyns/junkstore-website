# CLAUDE.md - Junk Store Website Project Context
**Documentation Organized:** July 29, 2025 - All project files now in unified `docs/` structure

## Project Overview
**Junk Store Website Optimization & Strategic Development**
- Jekyll-based static site for Junk Store 2.0 (Steam Deck app for non-Steam games)
- Focus: Performance optimization, SEO, strategic messaging, and conversion optimization
- Target: Steam Deck users wanting to play Epic, GOG & Amazon games without Desktop Mode

## Core Value Proposition & Brand Positioning
**Unique Competitive Advantages:**
- **Game Mode Native:** Never requires Desktop Mode switching - pure Steam integration
- **Direct Launch:** No launcher-within-launcher complexity - games launch directly
- **Unified Library:** Emulators integrated into Steam library alongside other games
- **Rapid Updates:** Direct update channels for quick fixes and feature rollouts
- **Native-like Experience:** Games integrated as natively as possible into Steam ecosystem

**Primary Message:** "Never leave Game Mode to play your Epic, GOG & Amazon games"
**Core Differentiation:** Complete Steam ecosystem integration vs external launcher solutions

### ⚠️ CRITICAL MESSAGING POLICY (July 29, 2025)
**NO DIRECT COMPETITOR COMPARISONS OR CALLOUTS**
- Avoid naming specific alternatives (Heroic, Lutris, NonSteamLaunchers, etc.)
- Focus on our unique value: Game Mode native experience
- Use respectful language: "alternatives" instead of competitor names
- Avoid potentially inaccurate claims about competitor features
- Maintain developer community relationships - don't be abrasive
- **This policy may be revisited in future but is firm for now**

## Documentation Organization Structure (Organized July 29, 2025)
- **Primary Documentation Hub:** `docs/` - Single organized location for all project documentation
- **Current Night Reports:** 
  - `docs/SITE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive site audit (July 29, 2025)
  - `docs/TUTORIAL_STRATEGY_REPORT.md` - High-impact tutorial strategy (July 29, 2025)
  - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Prioritized action items (July 29, 2025)
  - `docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE_PLAN.md` - Documentation system (July 29, 2025)
- **Organized Subfolders:**
  - `docs/agents/` - All agent documentation files
  - `docs/knowledge-base/` - Research reports and brand guides
  - `docs/project-management/` - Project tracking and roadmaps
  - `docs/operations/` - QA procedures and coordination protocols
  - `docs/reports/` - Executive summaries and technical reports
  - `docs/scripts/` - Automation and utility scripts

## User Preferences & Requirements

### Critical Protocols (NEVER VIOLATE)
- **ALWAYS read files before attempting to edit or write to them** (mandatory protocol)
- **NEVER delete docs/ directory or agent files without explicit permission**
- **ASK before major deletions or structural changes**
- **Reference CLAUDE.md at start of each session**
- **Update TodoWrite for all complex multi-step tasks**
- **Use parallel tool calls for efficiency when possible**
- **ALWAYS use relevant specialized agents when given tasks** (don't wait for user to prompt)

### Quality Standards
- Test all changes with Jekyll build verification: `bundle exec jekyll build`
- Follow QA procedures for any SCSS/build changes (safety first)
- Maintain dark theme consistency (no light mode switching)
- Verify git status before committing changes
- Use logical commit messages with proper attribution

### Communication Style
- **Be concise and direct** (user prefers minimal explanations unless asked)
- **Focus on actionable outcomes** over theoretical discussion
- **Provide specific file paths with line numbers** when referencing code
- **Use TodoWrite tool** to track progress on complex tasks
- **Batch related tasks** for efficiency

### Technical Preferences
- **Current Build System:** Jekyll with Minimal Mistakes theme
- **Table System:** JavaScript-based tables with JSON data (not Jekyll liquid)
- **Performance Priority:** Site optimized to 42.9MB (was 64.3MB)
- **Git Workflow:** 
  - **SEPARATE COMMITS REQUIRED:** Always separate website files from documentation files
    - **Website commits:** Files that affect the built site (_pages/, _sass/, assets/, _config.yml, etc.)
    - **Documentation commits:** Files in docs/, CLAUDE.md, and other development-only files
    - This allows clean cherry-picking for production builds
  - Logical commit messages with proper descriptions, avoid massive commits

## File Management Rules

### Never Delete/Modify Without Permission
- Any files in `docs/` directory (project management system)
- Current working table files (`tested-games.md`, `tested-games-js.md`)
- Active SCSS files in import chains
- Production image assets

### Safe to Clean Up (with confirmation)
- Backup files (*.backup)
- Clearly marked experimental/test files
- Redundant/duplicate functionality

### Git Ignore Pattern
```
# Project management and internal documentation
docs/
*.backup
vendor/
_site/
assets/lib
```
