# CLAUDE.md - Junk Store Website Project Context
**Documentation Organized:** July 29, 2025 - All project files now in unified `docs/` structure

## Project Overview
**Junk Store Website Optimization & Strategic Development**
- Jekyll-based static site for Junk Store 2.0 (Steam Deck app for non-Steam games)
- Focus: Performance optimization, SEO, strategic messaging, and conversion optimization
- Target: Steam Deck users wanting to play Epic, GOG & Amazon games without Desktop Mode

## Core Value Proposition & Brand Positioning
**Unique Competitive Advantages:**
- **Game Mode Native:** Never requires Desktop Mode switching - pure Steam integration
- **Direct Launch:** No launcher-within-launcher complexity - games launch directly
- **Unified Library:** Emulators integrated into Steam library alongside other games
- **Rapid Updates:** Direct update channels for quick fixes and feature rollouts
- **Native-like Experience:** Games integrated as natively as possible into Steam ecosystem

**Primary Message:** "Never leave Game Mode to play your Epic, GOG & Amazon games"
**Core Differentiation:** Complete Steam ecosystem integration vs external launcher solutions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL MESSAGING POLICY (July 29, 2025)
**NO DIRECT COMPETITOR COMPARISONS OR CALLOUTS**
- Avoid naming specific alternatives (Heroic, Lutris, NonSteamLaunchers, etc.)
- Focus on our unique value: Game Mode native experience
- Use respectful language: "alternatives" instead of competitor names
- Avoid potentially inaccurate claims about competitor features
- Maintain developer community relationships - don't be abrasive
- **This policy may be revisited in future but is firm for now**

## ü§ñ MANDATORY AGENT USAGE PROTOCOL
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Always use specialized agents - DO NOT work directly without agent consultation**

### When to Use Each Agent (MANDATORY)

#### üîß **Technical Work** ‚Üí `quality-assurance-build-safety-agent` 
**ALWAYS USE FOR:**
- Any SCSS/CSS changes or styling work
- Jekyll build modifications or configuration  
- File operations (create, edit, delete)
- Performance optimizations or mobile fixes
- Any changes that could break the site build

#### ‚úçÔ∏è **Content Work** ‚Üí `strategic-content-brand-consistency-agent`
**ALWAYS USE FOR:**
- Copywriting, messaging, or text changes
- FAQ organization or tutorial content
- Brand voice enforcement and consistency
- Marketing copy or competitive messaging
- Any user-facing content creation

#### üìä **Strategic Work** ‚Üí `strategic-positioning-market-intelligence-agent`
**ALWAYS USE FOR:**
- Competitive messaging or positioning
- Market analysis or value proposition work  
- Pricing justification or strategic decisions
- Competitor research or differentiation

#### üí∞ **Business Work** ‚Üí `business-conversion-revenue-optimization-agent`
**ALWAYS USE FOR:**
- Conversion optimization or homepage improvements
- Trial signup focus or user experience enhancements
- Revenue-focused decisions or A/B testing
- Customer journey optimization

#### üéØ **Complex Tasks** ‚Üí `project-coordination-quality-control-agent`
**ALWAYS USE FOR:**
- Multi-step tasks requiring multiple agents
- Quality control oversight and coordination
- Strategic planning or resource allocation
- Any task involving 3+ file changes

### üö® NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
1. **NEVER** perform specialized work without consulting the relevant agent first
2. **ALWAYS** delegate to agents immediately when starting any task
3. **MANDATORY** agent consultation - not optional or "when convenient"
4. **NO EXCEPTIONS** - even for "quick fixes" or "simple changes"

### Agent Deployment Pattern
```
Task Received ‚Üí Identify Type ‚Üí Deploy Relevant Agent ‚Üí Execute via Agent ‚Üí Quality Check
```

**Example:**
- User asks to "fix FAQ styling" ‚Üí Deploy `quality-assurance-build-safety-agent` + `strategic-content-brand-consistency-agent`
- User asks for "competitive messaging" ‚Üí Deploy `strategic-positioning-market-intelligence-agent` + `strategic-content-brand-consistency-agent`

## Documentation Organization Structure (Organized July 29, 2025)

  - `docs/knowledge-base/` - Research reports and brand guides
  - `docs/project-management/` - Project tracking and roadmaps
  - `docs/operations/` - QA procedures and coordination protocols
  - `docs/reports/` - Executive summaries and technical reports
  - `docs/scripts/` - Automation and utility scripts

## User Preferences & Requirements

### Critical Protocols (NEVER VIOLATE)
- **ALWAYS read files before attempting to edit or write to them** (mandatory protocol)
- **NEVER delete docs/ directory or agent files without explicit permission**
- **ASK before major deletions or structural changes**
- **Reference CLAUDE.md at start of each session**
- **Update TodoWrite for all complex multi-step tasks**
- **Use parallel tool calls for efficiency when possible**
- **FOLLOW MANDATORY AGENT USAGE PROTOCOL above** - never work without agents

### Quality Standards
- Test all changes with Jekyll build verification: `bundle exec jekyll build`
- Follow QA procedures for any SCSS/build changes (safety first)
- Maintain dark theme consistency (no light mode switching)
- Verify git status before committing changes
- Use logical commit messages with proper attribution

### Communication Style
- **Be concise and direct** (user prefers minimal explanations unless asked)
- **Focus on actionable outcomes** over theoretical discussion
- **Provide specific file paths with line numbers** when referencing code
- **Use TodoWrite tool** to track progress on complex tasks
- **Batch related tasks** for efficiency

### Technical Preferences
- **Current Build System:** Jekyll with Minimal Mistakes theme
- **Table System:** JavaScript-based tables with JSON data (not Jekyll liquid)
- **Performance Priority:** Site optimized to 42.9MB (was 64.3MB)
- **Git Workflow:** 
  - **SEPARATE COMMITS REQUIRED:** Always separate website files from documentation files
    - **Website commits:** Files that affect the built site (_pages/, _sass/, assets/, _config.yml, etc.)
    - **Documentation commits:** Files in docs/, CLAUDE.md, and other development-only files
    - This allows clean cherry-picking for production builds
  - Logical commit messages with proper descriptions, avoid massive commits

## File Management Rules

### Never Delete/Modify Without Permission
- Any files in `docs/` directory (project management system)
- Current working table files (`tested-games.md`, `tested-games-js.md`)
- Active SCSS files in import chains
- Production image assets

### Safe to Clean Up (with confirmation)
- Backup files (*.backup)
- Clearly marked experimental/test files
- Redundant/duplicate functionality

### Git Ignore Pattern
```
# Project management and internal documentation
docs/
*.backup
vendor/
_site/
assets/lib
```
