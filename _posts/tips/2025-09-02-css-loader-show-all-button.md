**This Week's Pro Tip:** If you're using the free Decky plugin and only seeing the first 100 games in your Epic/GOG library, look for the <strong>"Show All"</strong> prompt at the bottom of the screen!

*Note: This tip applies to the free Decky plugin version. Junk Store 2.0 (paid version) loads up to 1000 games automatically.*

## The Problem

You've installed Junk Store and your Epic/GOG games are syncing perfectly, but you can only see games alphabetically from A-L. Games starting with M-Z seem to be completely missing, even though you know you own them.

**This is a very common support question we get**, and there are two main causes: people simply don't notice the prompt, or CSS Loader themes are hiding it.

## Why This Happens (Decky Plugin Optimization)

## The Simple Solution

### Just Press Y!
1. Open your Epic/GOG library in Junk Store
2. **Navigate out of the search field** (scroll down to highlight any game in the list)
3. Look for the **"SHOW ALL"** button in the bottom menu (highlighted in red below)
4. **Press the Y button** on your Steam Deck
5. Wait a moment while your complete library loads
6. The rest of your games will now appear!

*The "SHOW ALL" button is located in Junk Store's bottom menu - press Y to load your complete library!*

## If You Can't See the Prompt

### Check Your CSS Loader Theme
Sometimes CSS Loader themes hide or modify the bottom menu area where this prompt appears:

1. **Temporarily disable your CSS theme** (CSS Loader â†’ Turn off theme)
2. Navigate back to your Epic/GOG library
3. **Move out of the search field** (scroll down to highlight a game) - the bottom menu should now appear with "SHOW ALL"
4. **Press Y** to load your complete library
5. Re-enable your theme if desired

**Can't see the button?** You can still **search for specific games** by name - Junk Store's search function works even when the "SHOW ALL" prompt is hidden.




## Pro Tips
