TL;DR: It's an integrated Epic launcher for the Steam Deck. ![Junk-Store](assets/images/website image.jpg){: w="200" h="100" }{: .right}

After over 7 months of development and countless hours at the keyboard, Junk-Store is finally ready to step out into the world.

But it's not just an Epic launcher; Junk-Store is a versatile Decky plugin that aims to redefine the steam deck experience. With its flexibility and user extensibility, even those with basic to intermediate programming skills can customize it to their heart's content. We've meticulously designed it to allow for the development of extensions without the need for writing any plugin code. While this feature is currently undocumented, we plan to provide documentation in the future.

You might wonder why not use Heroic? The answer is simple: Junk-Store is more akin to Lutris. It's not bound by any hard-coded constraints related to storefronts; in theory, it can do it all. However, in practice, there's still much work to be done.

We're proud to present Junk-Store to the Steam Deck community. The code is open and available on GitHub. The project has likely consumed close to 1000 man-hours, counting all the help we've received. While it may seem straightforward on the surface, it's far from it. We're constantly exploring new and innovative ways to utilize Junk-Store. We're yet to discover its limits; every time we think we've reached them, we find ways to push further.

We hope this project is met with the same passion we've poured into it over the last 7+ months. We're just getting started; there are many more exciting developments to come for Junk-Store.

So, as we raise our glasses in celebration, we invite you all to explore Junk-Store in the Decky store.

Let me know in the comments what you think about it. I really value feedback, good, bad, or otherwise.
