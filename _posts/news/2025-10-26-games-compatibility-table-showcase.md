Our games compatibility table has been quietly helping Steam Deck users find compatible games for a few months now, and I wanted to highlight it for those who might not know about it yet.

*Complete overview of our games compatibility table with all key features visible*

## Live Statistics Dashboard

First thing you'll see is our real-time breakdown of tested games across all supported platforms. No guessing - you know exactly what's been verified.

*Real-time statistics showing our growing database of tested games*

The numbers update automatically as we test more games each week, so you're always seeing the latest compatibility data.

## Recently Tested Games & Store Filtering

We highlight recently tested games right at the top, plus you can filter by any storefront to focus on your preferred platform. Here's the table filtered to show just GOG games:

*Filtering by GOG games - notice the clean store badges and organization*

## Comprehensive Game Details

This is where it gets really useful. Click any game and you get a detailed modal with actual testing information from our Steam Deck sessions:

Each modal includes:
- **Compatibility ratings** with clear explanations
- **Release information** and store details
- **Testing notes** from actual Steam Deck sessions
- **Special requirements** and configuration notes

## We Want Your Feedback
