## We're Consolidating

The Junk Store GOG extension is now only available through our [Portal](https://portal.junkstore.xyz/). We're no longer selling it on Patreon or Ko-fi.

## The Reality

There are two of us managing Junk Store, and handling sales, migrations, and updates across three platforms has become unsustainable. Manual migrations are time-consuming, and we understand that waiting for us to migrate on a schedule can be frustrating. Since we cannot automate the migration due to platform limitations, this is the best solution going forward.

## Moving Forward

- **Portal purchases = instant access**, no migration needed
- **All updates posted on Portal only**
- **All Patreon/Ko-fi migrations have been completed**

This frees us up to actually improve the product and help users faster.

If you have any issues, please reach out to us via the platform where you originally purchased the extension.

**Portal Link:** [https://portal.junkstore.xyz/](https://portal.junkstore.xyz/)

## How to Access Your Migrated Account

1. Go to the Portal: [https://portal.junkstore.xyz/](https://portal.junkstore.xyz/)
2. Click **Sign in**
3. Enter the exact email address you used when purchasing on Patreon
4. Click **"Forgot Password"**
5. Follow the password reset instructions
6. Log in and download the extension

## Having Issues?

If you're experiencing any problems:

- Download not showing after login
- Email not working or getting errors
- Can't remember which email you used

**Contact us via the platform where you originally purchased** (Patreon or Ko-fi) and we'll help sort it out.
