## Login Woes No More!

Hey Everyone!

Firstly, we want to express our heartfelt gratitude for the overwhelming reception that Junk Store has received in the past few days. The positive feedback has truly been incredible, and we're immensely thankful to those who persevered to get it up and running. Your patience and understanding mean the world to us. It's important to note that our team consists of just one developer, with another assisting on the UI, so all technical challenges ultimately come down to the expertise of one person.

Today has been a marathon of sorts, with countless hours spent delving into various codebases. Our developer has been tirelessly tracking down the root cause of the login issue that has been affecting Junk Store users. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. This challenge caught us off guard, as it wasn't related to Junk Store code directly. We were left scratching our heads until we uncovered the underlying issue.

Upon investigation, we discovered that an update to Pywebview introduced some breaking changes, which subsequently affected Legendary and, consequently, Junk Store. To address this, we've reverted to a previous version of Pywebview that is known to be stable. We've then rebuilt the flatpak, and the updated version is now available. To ensure you're on the **latest version**, simply click on **'install dependencies'** to update to the new flatpak.

Thank you again for your patience, and if you encounter any issues going forward, please don't hesitate to join us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/6mRUhR6Teh) for a faster response. Your participation also helps other users by consolidating fixes in one accessible location, rather than scattered across the web.

Game on!
