## The Problem
Many Steam Deck users don't realize that Game Mode has powerful keyboard shortcuts that can save tons of time. Most people fumble through menus when they could be using quick key combinations.

## Junk Store Specific Shortcuts

When using <a href="/buy_now/">Junk Store 2.0</a>, these shortcuts work perfectly:

### Quick Game Launch
- **Steam + Search**: Use the search function to quickly find your Epic/GOG/Amazon games
- **Steam + L1/R1**: Navigate between different game libraries without mouse
- **Steam + Select**: Access game properties and launch options

### Troubleshooting Mode
- **Steam + L3 + R3**: Quick access to developer console (useful for Proton debugging)
- **Steam + Menu**: Open controller configuration while in any Junk Store game

## Pro Tips for Power Users

### 1. Chain Shortcuts Together
- Press **Steam + A** → **Steam + X** for quick text input in any game
- Use **Steam + B** → **Steam + Y** to force close and immediately screenshot error messages

### 2. Muscle Memory Training
Practice these shortcuts daily for 5 minutes. Within a week, you'll be navigating 3x faster than using touchscreen alone.

### 3. Custom Controller Configurations
Set up controller profiles in your most-played Junk Store games with these shortcuts mapped to paddles or unused buttons.

## Advanced Workflow
Here's my personal daily workflow using these shortcuts:

1. **Morning**: Steam + Search → "Epic" to see new free games
2. **Gaming**: Steam + Y for screenshots, Steam + Menu for quick settings
3. **Troubleshooting**: Steam + B to force close problematic games
4. **Night**: Steam + A → Power options for proper shutdown
