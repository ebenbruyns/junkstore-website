## Two Weeks In: itch.io Integration Reality Check

Remember when we announced the [first-ever itch.io integration into Steam](./games-tested-aug-19)? It's been **2 weeks** since we released this groundbreaking feature in beta, and we need to talk.

### 🎯 **The Good News**
- **Zero major crashes** reported (phew!)
- **15+ successful game installs** confirmed by early testers
- **Indie devs are noticing** - we've had several reach out asking about compatibility
- **The foundation works** - our custom itch client is solid

### 🤔 **The Reality Check**
We're being honest here: **we don't know if this is what you actually want.**

This was a passion project - something we thought would be cool for the indie gaming community. But passion projects only matter if people use them.

## What We Need From YOU

We built this integration **for you**, not for us. So here's what would help us make it incredible:

### 📊 **Usage Data** (Anonymous)
- Have you tried the itch integration? **Yes/No**
- If not, what's stopping you? **Tell us**
- If yes, what's missing? **Be specific**

### 🎮 **Real Game Testing**
We need to know which itch games you **actually want to play**:

- **Your wishlist games** - which itch titles are you excited about?
- **Problem games** - what doesn't install or run properly?
- **Must-have features** - what would make you use this daily?

### 🔧 **Feature Priorities**

Right now our itch integration supports:
- ✅ Windows games only
- ✅ Basic install/uninstall
- ✅ Steam library integration
- ✅ Game Mode compatibility

**Missing features we could add:**
- 🤷‍♂️ Linux native games support
- 🤷‍♂️ Collection browsing
- 🤷‍♂️ Developer following
- 🤷‍♂️ Community features
- 🤷‍♂️ Update notifications

**Which of these matter to YOU?**

## The Honest Truth

Here's the thing: if nobody uses this, we'll sunset it and focus elsewhere. We'd rather build features you love than maintain ones you ignore.

But if there's genuine demand, we'll double down. We'll expand platform support, add more features, and make it the best way to play indie games on Steam Deck.

2. **What's your biggest itch.io use case** - game jams, experimental indie games, visual novels?

### ⚠️ **Beta Warnings**
- This is **very beta** - expect rough edges
- **Windows games only** for now
- **Report issues** to help us improve

## What Happens Next?

Based on your feedback over the next **2 weeks**, we'll make a decision:

**High demand + good feedback** = Full development, stable release, expanded features  
**Low demand + mixed feedback** = Maintenance mode, focus elsewhere  
**No feedback** = We assume nobody cares and move on

## Your Voice Matters

This isn't corporate speak - we're a small team that listens. Every piece of feedback directly influences our roadmap.

The itch.io integration could be something special - the **first and only way** to play itch games directly through Steam on Steam Deck. But only if you want it.

**So... do you?**
