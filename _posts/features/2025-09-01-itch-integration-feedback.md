## We Need Your Help with itch.io Integration

It's been **2 weeks** since we launched the first-ever itch.io integration into Steam. We need to know: **should we keep building this?**

### üéØ **Current Status**
- Zero major crashes reported
- 15+ successful game installs by beta testers  
- Basic functionality working (Windows games only)
- Steam library integration complete

### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **The Challenge**
We're not getting feedback on GitHub - maybe it's working great, or maybe people haven't tried it yet. Either way, we need to know to plan what's next.

## We Made Forms to Make This Easy

Since GitHub seems too complicated, we created simple forms:

**Found a Bug?** ‚Üí [Bug Report Form](/itch-bug-report/)  
**Want a Feature?** ‚Üí [Feature Request Form](/itch-feature-request/)  
**General Feedback?** ‚Üí Comment below or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6mRUhR6Teh)

## How to Test It

**Existing customers**: Set both build and extension channels to **beta**  
**Trial users**: Beta is included  
**New users**: [Start your free trial](/buy_now/)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Beta Status**
- Windows games only (Linux coming if there's demand)
- Expect rough edges
- Please report issues using the forms above

## Decision Time

We're giving this **2 more weeks**. Then we decide:

**Good feedback** = Keep building  
**No feedback** = Focus on other priorities

---

**TL;DR**: itch.io integration works but we need feedback to know what to prioritize next. Use the forms above to help us decide.
