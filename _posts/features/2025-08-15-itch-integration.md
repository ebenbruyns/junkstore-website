## For the First Time Ever: Itch.io ‚Üí Steam Integration

This is hot off the press: I've been on a little side quest to get **Itch.io working**, and it's now live in the beta branch for all existing Junk Store 2.0 customers.

**Historic milestone**: This is the **first time ever** that Itch.io has been integrated directly into Steam.

## üöÄ How to Try It Right Now

- **Existing customers**: Set both build and extension channels to **beta**
- **New users**: The fully functional trial includes all builds for testing
- **Trial users**: [Start your 7-day free trial](/buy_now/) - beta access included

**Important**: You must have both build and extension channels set to beta.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Beta Reality Check

**Heads up ‚Äî this is very beta.** I had to build an Itch.io client completely from scratch since no suitable CLI client existed. 

**Current limitations**:
- Narrow, Windows games implementation
- Barebones feature set  
- Tested on handful of games - expect edge cases

Rather than spend six months perfecting it in a vacuum, I'm releasing it early to get real user feedback.

## üéØ Why Early Release?

**Feature priorities** ‚Äì You tell me what you want most.

**Demand check** ‚Äì I'll know how many people actually care about Itch.io support.

**Real-world testing** ‚Äì Better than any internal QA process.

## üêõ Found a Bug? Here's How to Help

If you run into bugs (and you probably will), please report them here:  
**[GitHub Issues: JunkStoreBugs](https://github.com/SDK-Innovation/JunkStoreBugs/issues)**

**Pro tip**: Make sure to search first to avoid duplicates ‚Äî I'll prioritise fixes based on how many people are affected.

## üìà The Goal

**Get to 80% coverage** of games and use cases as fast as possible so most of you can play most of what you want, sooner.

This isn't about perfection on day one - it's about rapid iteration based on your real usage patterns.

## üéÆ What This Means for You

- **Thousands of indie games** now accessible through Steam
- **Steam Deck native experience** - no Desktop Mode required  
- **Same Junk Store quality** - compatibility tested and rated
- **Unified library** - all your games in one place

## The Development Story

I've been incredibly busy on Junk Store since launch, but this was a fun dash to get something cool in your hands.

**The challenge**: No existing itch.io CLI client suitable for our needs  
**The solution**: Build one from scratch  
**The result**: First-ever Steam integration for itch.io games

## What Happens Next?

Your feedback over the coming weeks will determine how far we take this integration:

- **High usage + good feedback** = Full feature development
- **Issues but interest** = Bug fixes and improvements  
- **Low adoption** = Maintenance mode

## Try It Today

This is bleeding edge stuff - you're getting access to something that's never existed before. The indie gaming community on Steam Deck just got a whole lot bigger.
