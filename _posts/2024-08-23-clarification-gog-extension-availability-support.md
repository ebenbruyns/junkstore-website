Dear Junk-Store users,

The two of us wanted to reach out to you all regarding a few things that have recently been brought to our attention.

Firstly, we have had some feedback from the community around the Gog extension support and its availability. This post is to clear up any confusion around its support and availability to our users.

We want to make it clear that you do not need to sign up to a monthly subscription in order to use the Gog extension. Once you have downloaded the script and installed it, it is yours to keep and use forever. We cannot take it away from you or remove this functionality from the Junk-Store plugin.

Due to having a large number of people sign up and cancel we assumed, incorrectly, that everyone was aware they could do this. While we greatly appreciate our monthly subscribers, we don't want people to feel obligated to continue their monthly subscription. If you are worried that by cancelling your subscription you will lose this functionality, you won't. We want to make that explicitly clear; the script is yours for continued personal use if you choose to cancel or downgrade your subscription.

Due to confusion to new users around whether or not you need to sign up to a monthly subscription to get it, we have utilised a new Ko-fi & Patreon feature where you can have paid posts. The Gog extension is now available in the newly activated [Ko-fi Shop](https://ko-fi.com/junkstore/shop) or [Patreon shop](https://www.patreon.com/junkstore/shop). The cost is higher than signing up as a Trailblazer then cancelling due to higher shop fees ($6 instead of $5). Like with everything, added fees are a killer. You can use either method to get the Gog extension, but if you sign up as a Trailblazer (even if you cancel straight away) you also get access to the 'Cloud Saves' script. Keep in mind cloud saves are unsupported so use at your own risk.

Secondly, our dev has been working long hours these past months on Junk-Store. So please rest assured that those of you who are monthly supporters, we are working away at making Junk-Store bigger and better! We are truly thankful for your continued belief in and support of this project. We have some big news on the horizon with some amazing features and functionality being added, so stay tuned. 

Those of you who have been long-time supporters and/or those of you who wish to continue to support the project, we will have something special for you as a way of saying thank you. 

Also don't forget if you ever have any issues or questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We are new to all this, so if something is bothering you or isn't clear please let us know.

Thank you again,
The Junk-Store Team
