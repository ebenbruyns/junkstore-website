As dedicated gamers, we understand the importance of having access to your favorite games across different platforms. That's why we've been hard at work creating a solution to seamlessly integrate GOG games into the Steam Deck ecosystem.

For those of you with a stash of GOG games, we now have a beta version ready for testing, available to our Faithful supporters via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/junkstore). Once all the bugs and kinks are worked out, it will be rolled out to our Trailblazer patrons. If you want to stay up-to-date with all future releases and updates, join our Patreon community. Whether you choose a free or paid membership, weâ€™d love to have you with us.

With the new GOG extension, you'll be able to enjoy all your beloved GOG titles right from your Steam Deck, without the hassle of switching between platforms or launching external applications. Whether it's classic RPGs, indie gems, or AAA blockbusters, the GOG extension ensures that your gaming library is at your fingertips wherever you go.

But it doesn't stop there! Our commitment to innovation means that we're continuously refining and improving the GOG extension to provide you with the best possible gaming experience. From enhanced performance to seamless integration with Steam's interface, we're dedicated to delivering a solution that exceeds your expectations.

So, what are you waiting for? Join us on this gaming adventure and be among the first to experience the power of the GOG extension on your Steam Deck. Stay tuned for updates and sneak peeks for our supporters. Let's level up gaming together! ðŸŽ®âœ¨ #JunkStore #GamingRevolution
