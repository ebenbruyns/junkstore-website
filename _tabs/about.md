## What is Junk-Store?

Junk-Store is a revolutionary plugin designed to enhance your gaming experience on the Steam Deck. Developed with passion and innovation, Junk-Store seamlessly integrates non-Steam games into your Steam Deck library, opening up a world of gaming possibilities beyond Steam.

Imagine having all your streaming services unified into one interface; a single hub where you can navigate your Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+ accounts, and more, all in one easy-to-search platform. Think of something like Kodi, and you'll get a sense of what we’re aiming to build for the Steam Deck.

This is the vision behind Junk Store, but instead of streaming services, it’s for all your non-Steam games. The developer of Junk Store wants to turn the Steam Deck into an "everything" deck. Junk Store’s goal is to provide an interface that allows you to easily access all your non-Steam games, no matter which store or platform they’re from, directly from Game Mode.
