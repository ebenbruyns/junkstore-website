# Buy Now Page - Current vs Proposed

## CURRENT VERSION (Comparison-Heavy)

**Structure:**
1. Hero: "Transform Your Steam Deck Into a Unified Gaming Hub"
2. SEO intro paragraph (comparison language)
3. Visual demo with progressive CTA
4. "Why Junk Store 2.0 Is Worth the Investment" (6 feature comparisons)
5. Testimonials + CTA
6. Quick Questions FAQ (6 items)
7. Pricing details section
8. Support & community

**Problems:**
- Still using comparison language ("ONLY solution", "while other launchers")
- Feature section feels like homepage repeat
- Multiple scattered CTAs
- Focus on "worth the investment" rather than action

---

## PROPOSED VERSION (Action-Oriented)

**Structure:**
1. **Simple Hero**: "Ready to Start Your 7-Day Free Trial?"
2. **3-Step Process**:
   - Step 1: Start Free Trial (no payment required)
   - Step 2: Test with your actual games
   - Step 3: Keep it if you love it
3. **What You Get** (simple list, not comparisons):
   - Epic, GOG, Amazon & itch.io games in Game Mode
   - No Desktop Mode switching
   - Professional updates and support
4. **Visual Demo** (keep existing)
5. **Testimonials** (keep existing)
6. **Risk-Free Promise**:
   - 7 days to test everything
   - Only charged if you keep it
   - Cancel anytime, keep games forever
7. **Quick Questions FAQ** (keep existing - it's good)
8. **Single CTA Section**: Start Free Trial

**Benefits:**
- Focuses on the trial process, not comparisons
- Reduces decision fatigue
- Clear progression: Try → Test → Keep
- Less overwhelming for people ready to buy
- Single primary action throughout

---

**Key Changes:**
- Remove comparison language ("ONLY solution", "others require")
- Replace "Why it's worth it" with "What you get"
- Add clear 3-step trial process
- Consolidate CTAs to one primary action
- Keep FAQ (it addresses real concerns)
- Make it about taking action, not deciding
