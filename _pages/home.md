  <h2>Why Choose Junk Store Over Free Alternatives?</h2>
  <div class="comparison-grid">
    <div class="comparison-item">
      <h3>üéØ Desktop Mode Dependency</h3>
      <p><strong>Most alternatives:</strong> Excellent desktop applications designed for traditional PC workflows</p>
      <p><strong>The structural difference:</strong> Desktop-based architecture requires switching out of handheld mode</p>
      <p><strong>Junk Store approach:</strong> Game Mode-native architecture eliminates desktop switching entirely</p>
    </div>
    <div class="comparison-item">
      <h3>üéØ Workflow Philosophy</h3>
      <p><strong>Most alternatives:</strong> Desktop-first design with comprehensive configuration options</p>
      <p><strong>The structural difference:</strong> Designed for users comfortable with desktop game management</p>
      <p><strong>Junk Store approach:</strong> Handheld-first design prioritizing controller navigation and simplicity</p>
    </div>
    <div class="comparison-item">
      <h3>üéØ Library Access & Integration</h3>
      <p><strong>Most alternatives:</strong> Must launch separate launcher apps to view your library and install games</p>
      <p><strong>The structural difference:</strong> Need to open the launcher application first to browse and install from your Epic, GOG, or Amazon libraries</p>
      <p><strong>Junk Store approach:</strong> Entire library (installed and uninstalled games) visible directly in Game Mode</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="comparison-conclusion">
    <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Excellent free alternatives serve users comfortable with launching separate apps for game management. Junk Store's $40/year serves users who want everything accessible directly in Game Mode - a fundamentally different architectural approach.</p>
