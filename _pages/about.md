Junk Store exists to make non-Steam gaming on the Steam Deck as effortless as native Steam games. We’re building a unified, intuitive hub where players can install, launch, and manage games from other platforms—like Epic and GOG—right from Game Mode.

Inspired by the simplicity of platforms like Kodi, our goal is to turn the Steam Deck into an “everything deck.” One interface. Minimal friction. Maximum access.

We’re committed to active development, community feedback, and making it feel like it just works—because gaming should be fun, not frustrating.


<h2>Our Mission</h2>

Junk Store is built to make playing non-Steam games feel as seamless and intuitive as launching native Steam titles.

- <strong>Low-Friction Setup</strong>  
  No complicated steps—just install, launch, and play.

- <strong>Seamless Integration</strong> 
  Easily add and update games from platforms like Epic Games, Gog and Amazon directly onto your Steam Deck.

- <strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong>
  Navigate your library easily and discover new titles without the hassle.

- <strong>Active Development</strong>
  We're constantly improving Junk Store with regular updates and new features based on your feedback.
