<h1>🎉 Junk Store 2.0 is finally here!</h1>
Junk Store 2.0 is now available for purchase.

<p>A single $40 yearly license gives you everything — updates, features, support, and peace of mind — plus a <strong>7-day free trial</strong> so you can try everything risk-free.</p>


<h3>This is the biggest upgrade we’ve ever done:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>⚡ Faster everything — UI, extension generation, and library loading</li>
    <li>🎮 Unified launcher for all your games</li>
    <li>🧠 One-click automation for generating entire libraries</li>
    <li>💾 Automatic migration of saves, settings, and install data</li>
</ul>

✅ Your 7-day free trial starts now — and any discount tied to your previous support is already applied at checkout.
<li>💸 Use code <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">EarlyBird</span> at checkout for <strong>25% off</strong> — valid until <strong>July 31, 2025</strong></li>
<li>⚠️ Spots are limited — we’ll close signups temporarily once we hit our support capacity.</li>
<li>🕒 Heads-up: If you cancel your trial, your discount won’t carry over.</li><br>
 This isn’t a pressure tactic — we just don’t have the bandwidth right now to automate discount tracking across cancellations. Thanks for understanding while we scale.
