**Junk Store is the ONLY solution that keeps you in Game Mode.**

While other launchers require Desktop Mode for game management, Junk Store exists to make <strong>non-Steam gaming on Steam Deck</strong> as effortless as native Steam games. We're building a unified, intuitive hub where players can install, launch, and manage games from Epic, GOG, and Amazon directly in <strong>Steam Deck Game Mode</strong> without ever switching modes.

**Why we built this differently:** Your Steam Deck was designed for handheld gaming. Other solutions treat it like a mini-PC, requiring Desktop Mode with mouse-based interfaces and complex workflows. Junk Store respects the handheld experience—everything works with your Steam Deck's controller in Game Mode.

We're committed to active development, community feedback, and making it feel like it just works—because gaming should be fun, not frustrating.


<h2>Our Mission</h2>

Junk Store is built to make playing non-Steam games feel as seamless and intuitive as launching native Steam titles.

- <strong>Low-Friction Setup</strong>  
  No complicated steps—just install, launch, and play.

- <strong>Seamless Integration</strong> 
  Easily add and update games from platforms like Epic Games, Gog and Amazon directly onto your Steam Deck.

- <strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong>
  Navigate your library easily and discover new titles without the hassle.

- <strong>Active Development</strong>
  We're constantly improving Junk Store with regular updates and new features based on your feedback.
