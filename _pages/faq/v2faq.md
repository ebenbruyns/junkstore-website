  <summary>Is Junk Store trustworthy and how are my credentials handled?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Yes, Junk Store is trustworthy.</strong> We prioritize user security and transparency in how we handle your gaming credentials.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Credential Security:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>🔒 <strong>No password storage:</strong> Junk Store never stores your Epic, GOG, Amazon, or itch.io (beta) passwords</li>
      <li>🎫 <strong>Token-based authentication:</strong> Uses secure login tokens provided by each platform</li>
      <li>💻 <strong>Local storage only:</strong> All tokens stored locally on your Steam Deck</li>
      <li>🔐 <strong>Standard OAuth flow:</strong> Same login method used by official store websites</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Privacy Protection:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>📊 <strong>No personal data collection:</strong> We don't collect or store personal information</li>
      <li>🎮 <strong>No game tracking:</strong> Your gaming habits aren't monitored or reported</li>
      <li>🛡️ <strong>Local operation:</strong> Most functionality works entirely offline</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Technical Trust Factors:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ <strong>Established developer:</strong> Active in Steam Deck community since launch with well-established security credentials</li>

<details class="faq-box" id="what-makes-junk-store-different">
  <summary>What makes Junk Store different from free alternatives?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Junk Store is Steam Deck-specific software</strong> designed exclusively for handheld gaming workflows, while alternatives are general PC gaming tools adapted for Steam Deck.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Key differences:</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>1. Steam Deck Controller Navigation:</strong> Every interaction optimized for the full Steam Deck controller experience - analog sticks, D-pad, buttons, touchpads
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>2. Game Mode Native:</strong> Works entirely within Game Mode - no desktop switching required to view libraries or install games
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>3. Direct Launch:</strong> Games launch directly without nested launchers - no "launcher to launch a launcher to launch your game" complexity
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>4. Unified Library:</strong> Epic, GOG, Amazon & itch.io (beta) games AND emulators integrated into your Steam library as if they were native Steam games
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>5. Built-in Automation:</strong> Dependency management, artwork caching, and ROM downloads handled automatically
  <br>
  <br>
    If Desktop Mode workflows work for you, free alternatives are excellent choices. Junk Store focuses specifically on seamless Game Mode integration for users who prefer staying in the Steam ecosystem.
  <br>

    </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-box" id="can-i-try-before-buy">
  <summary>Can I try before I buy to see if it's worth $40?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Absolutely.</strong> Every Junk Store annual license includes a <strong>7-day free trial</strong> with full access to all features:
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Trial includes:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Full Epic, GOG, Amazon & itch.io (beta) Games integration</li>
      <li>✅ Emulator setup and ROM management</li>
      <li>✅ Extension generator and custom store creation</li>
      <li>✅ All premium features (cloud saves, dependencies, automation)</li>
      <li>✅ Technical support via Discord</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Trial recommendations:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>🎯 Test with your existing game library — generate extensions for your owned games</li>
      <li>⚡ Try the automation features — let Junk Store set up several games automatically</li>
      <li>🎮 Use it exclusively in Game Mode — experience the workflow difference</li>
      <li>🔧 Experiment with advanced features — dependencies, custom extensions, emulators</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>No commitment:</strong> Cancel anytime during trial period for zero charges. If you cancel, you can still access the free Decky version for basic Epic Games support.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Trial tip:</strong> Most users know within 2-3 days whether the convenience justifies the cost. The 7-day window gives you plenty of time to test real-world usage patterns.
</details>

<details class="faq-box" id="trial-length-what-happens">
  <summary>How long is my trial and what happens when it ends?</summary>
  <p></p>
    You get <strong>7 days free</strong> to try all features. During the trial, you have full access to Epic, GOG, Amazon & itch.io (beta) integration, emulator extension creation, and all premium features.
  <br>
  <br>
    After 7 days, if you don't subscribe, you'll lose access to the Junk Store 2.0 interface and games installed in the new version. You can reactivate anytime to restore full functionality.
</details>

<details class="faq-box" id="what-happens-no-renew">
  <summary>What happens if I don't renew my annual license?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>You keep access to the version of Junk Store 2.0 you paid for.</strong> Everything continues working as normal, but you won't receive future updates.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>What continues working:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ All games installed through Junk Store 2.0 remain playable</li>
      <li>✅ Full Junk Store 2.0 functionality you paid for</li>
      <li>✅ Installing and managing games</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>What you won't get going forward:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>❌ New software updates and features</li>
      <li>❌ Bug fixes and compatibility improvements</li>
      <li>❌ New game store integrations</li>
      <li>❌ Technical support</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Steam Deck/Valve updates may break functionality over time. Active license holders receive compatibility fixes to address these issues.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> You can reactivate anytime to resume receiving updates and support.

<details class="faq-box" id="how-many-devices">
  <summary>How many devices can I install Junk Store on?</summary>
  <p></p>
    You can install Junk Store on up to <strong>five</strong> devices under a single license. We think this strikes a fair balance between flexibility and sustainability.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Device management:</strong> Each installation counts toward your device limit when you first activate it. If you need to replace a device or reinstall, contact support for assistance with license transfers.
</details>

<details class="faq-box" id="annual-license-or-perpetual">
  <summary>Do I need to keep paying to use the software?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Junk Store uses a perpetual license model with optional annual updates. You own your software version forever, but updates require an active annual license.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Junk Store uses perpetual licensing with annual update support.</strong> This is different from both traditional annual license software and one-time purchase models.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>What requires active annual license:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>🔄 Software updates and new features</li>
      <li>🛠️ Bug fixes and compatibility improvements</li>
      <li>🆕 New game store integrations</li>
      <li>💬 Technical support and troubleshooting</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>The reality of "permanent" ownership:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>⚠️ <strong>Steam Deck OS updates</strong> may break functionality over time</li>
      <li>⚠️ <strong>Third-party dependencies</strong> may become outdated or incompatible</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Our commitment to long-term stability:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>🛠️ <strong>We're actively working</strong> to make Junk Store as stable as possible even after annual license expiration</li>
      <li>🤝 <strong>Seeking Valve partnership:</strong> This complex task would be significantly easier with Valve's blessing and cooperation</li>
      <li>📦 <strong>Current approach:</strong> Game store changes continue working via updated flatpaks (free and open source) with publicly available manifests</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Bottom line:</strong> While you technically "own" your version forever, the Steam Deck ecosystem evolves constantly. We're endeavoring to minimize breakage over time, but this is a big and complicated technical challenge that would benefit greatly from official Steam platform support.
</details>

<details class="faq-box" id="free-decky-available">
  <summary>Will the free Decky version continue to be available?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Yes.</strong> The open source Decky version remains available for the community, free to use and collaborate on.
  <br>
  <br>
    Junk Store 2.0 is completely separate software that doesn't share code with the open source version. Both versions can coexist, and you can choose what works best for your needs.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Key difference:</strong> The free Decky version focuses on basic Epic Games support, while Junk Store 2.0 provides the complete Game Mode native experience across multiple platforms.

<details class="faq-box" id="how-to-access-junk-store">
  <summary>I just signed up for the trial. How do I access Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    After installing Junk Store 2.0, you access it by pressing the <strong>Select</strong> button above the D-pad on your Steam Deck or <strong>Ctrl+3</strong> if using a PC. No need to switch to Desktop Mode or launch separate applications.
  <br>
  <br>
    This opens directly in Game Mode, giving you immediate access to your Epic, GOG, Amazon & itch.io (beta) game libraries.
</details>

<details class="faq-box" id="what-to-do-first">
  <summary>What should I do first after accessing Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Log into Junk Store</li>
    <li>Generate extensions for the platforms you want to use (Epic, GOG, Amazon, itch.io (beta))</li>
    <li>Log into your game store accounts when prompted</li>
    <li>Your existing libraries will automatically sync and appear in Junk Store</li>
    <li>Start installing games directly from Game Mode</li>
  </ol>
    The initial library sync can take a few minutes as Junk Store builds the database for each platform.
  <br><br>
    <strong>Try This During Your Trial:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>🎯 Install 2-3 games  to see the automation difference</li>
      <li>⚡ Compare setup time vs Desktop Mode alternatives you've used</li>
      <li>🎮 Notice how everything stays in Game Mode without app switching</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Most users know within 2-3 days if the convenience justifies the cost.</strong> The 7-day trial gives plenty of time to test real usage patterns.

<details class="faq-box" id="new-platforms-planned">
  <summary>What new platforms are planned for future releases?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Current platform support:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ <strong>Itch.io</strong> - Now available in beta</li>
  </ul>
    <strong>Planned platform support</strong> (pending successful launch and resources):
  <ul>
    <li>🎮 <strong>EA, Ubisoft, Battle.net</strong> - If technically viable</li>
    <li>🔧 <strong>Community extension sharing</strong> - User-created platform support</li>
  </ul>
    <strong>Development approach:</strong> Each new platform requires extensive testing and compatibility work. We prioritize stable, Game Mode native implementations over quick additions.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Base your purchase decision on current features, not future promises. New platforms will be added as development resources allow.

</details>

<details class="faq-box" id="import-games-from-decky">
  <summary>How do I import and play my games from the Decky version in Junk Store 2.0?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Automatic Import:</strong> This happens automatically when you first install and launch Junk Store 2.0. Once you've generated the extensions (Epic and/or GOG), your games will sync across when you open each corresponding tab.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Playing Imported Games:</strong> Yes, your games will work, but you'll need to <strong>Reset Launch Options</strong> for each game (found in the sliders menu on the game page). This only needs to be done once per game to fully migrate it to the new version.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The initial import process can take some time, as Junk Store is rebuilding the databases for each storefront.
  </details>


<details class="faq-box" data-advanced="true" id="install-custom-proton">
  <summary>How do I install custom Proton versions (like GE-Proton)?</summary>
  <p></p>
    To get GE-Proton or other custom Proton versions, use one of these tools:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ProtonUp-QT</strong> — Download from the <strong>Discover Store</strong> (Desktop Mode)</li>
    <li><strong>Wine Cellar</strong> — Install from the <strong>Decky Plugin Store</strong> (if you have Decky)</li>
  </ul>
    After installation, download the latest <strong>GE-Proton</strong> release. You can then select it as a compatibility option when changing Proton versions (see "How do I change the Proton version for a game?" below).
    <br>
    <br>
    For detailed steps, see our <a href="{{ '/plugin_tutorials/' | relative_url }}">Plugin Tutorials</a> page.
</details>

<details class="faq-box" id="manage-game-storage">
  <summary>How do I manage game storage and SD card downloads?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Changing Download Location:</strong> You can set your preferred download location for each platform separately:
  <ul>
    <li>Go to the <strong>Epic</strong>, <strong>GOG</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong>, or <strong>itch.io (beta)</strong> tab</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>⚙️ Gear icon</strong> to open settings</li>
    <li>Set your desired download path (e.g. your SD card directory)</li>
    <li>Press <kbd>X</kbd> to save your changes</li>
    <li>Repeat for each platform you want to configure</li>
  </ul>
    <strong>Moving Existing Games:</strong> Not currently supported. Moving installed games to SD card is a complex feature on our development roadmap. For now, games need to be stored on internal storage or an already-mounted drive.
</details>

<details class="faq-box" id="install-uninstall-game">
  <summary>How do I install or uninstall a game?</summary>
  <p></p>
  <strong>To install a game in Junk Store:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the game's page in Junk Store and click install.</li>
    <li>Games are added to the download queue - you can navigate away and continue using Junk Store while they install.</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>To uninstall a game in Junk Store:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the game's page in Junk Store.</li>
    <li>Open the <strong>☰ Slider menu</strong> and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li>
    <li>
      Manually delete any leftover files to free up space:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Epic:</strong> <code>~/Games/epic</code> or <code>/*your-SD-card*/Games/epic</code></li>
        <li><strong>GOG:</strong> <code>~/Games/gog</code> or <code>/*your-SD-card*/Games/gog</code></li>
        <li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <code>~/Games/amazon</code> or <code>/*your-SD-card*/Games/amazon</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Uninstalling removes all local save data. To back up saves first, see "How do I find save data for my games?" below.
</details>

<details class="faq-box" data-advanced="true" id="find-save-data">
  <summary>How do I find save data for my games?</summary>
  <p></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Find the game's <strong>Steam ID</strong> at the bottom of its page in Junk Store.
    </li>
    <li>
      Navigate to the following path on your Steam Deck:<br>
      <code>~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/&lt;SteamID&gt;/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      From there, follow the path used by your game. Here are some examples:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Epic example:</strong> <code>Local Settings/Application Data/Dying Light/Saved</code></li>
        <li><strong>GOG example:</strong> <code>AppData/Roaming/Lonely Troops/Hero of the Kingdom II</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
    Each game may store saves in slightly different locations depending on how it was packaged or ported. Look under <code>AppData</code>, <code>Local Settings</code>, or <code>Documents</code> within the Steam compatibility prefix.

</details>

<details class="faq-box" data-advanced="true" id="install-game-dependencies">
  <summary>How do I install game dependencies on Steam Deck without Proton Tricks?</summary>

<details class="faq-box" id="migrate-games-to-decky">
  <summary>How do I migrate games back to the Decky (free) version?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>It depends on when the games were originally installed:</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>✅ Games originally from Decky version:</strong> These CAN be migrated back. For already installed games, open the game page in Junk Store and use <strong>Reset Launch Options</strong> from the sliders menu. This completes the migration back to Decky compatibility.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>❌ Games newly installed in Junk Store 2.0:</strong> These cannot be migrated back to Decky due to different install paths and configuration systems.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>For games newly installed in 2.0 that you want to keep:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Back up your save files for any games you plan to keep playing</li>
      <li>Manually uninstall games installed via the new version before your trial expires (to free up space)</li>
      <li>Reinstall those games using the Decky version</li>
      <li>Restore your game saves manually</li>
    </ul>
     <strong>Tip:</strong> Complete this process before your trial ends — otherwise, you may lose access and the games will still occupy storage.
</details>

<details class="faq-box" id="uninstall-junk-store">
  <summary>How do I uninstall Junk Store 2.0?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Before uninstalling, complete the migration process outlined in "How do I migrate games back to the Decky version?" above to preserve your games and saves.
  <br>
  <br>
    Once migration is complete, run the uninstall script in konsole:
    <code>~/.local/share/junkstore/uninstall.sh</code>

<details class="faq-box" id="third-party-launchers">
  <summary>Do games requiring third-party launchers (EA, Ubisoft, etc.) work with Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>EA Games:</strong> No, EA games are not supported. They require the EA Launcher, which isn't integrated with Junk Store. EA titles will not appear in your Epic Games library when accessed through Junk Store.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Ubisoft Games:</strong> It's complicated. Some Ubisoft titles appear in your Epic library, while others don't. The Ubisoft Launcher is not officially supported, but some users have successfully installed it manually and run select games.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Other Third-Party Launchers:</strong> Not currently supported. While Legendary has limited support, this feature isn't implemented in Junk Store yet. You can attempt manual setup via CLI or modify the extension script.
  <br>
  <br>

<details class="faq-box" id="gog-dos-scummvm-support">
  <summary>Does the GOG extension support DOS and ScummVM games?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Yes.</strong> In Junk Store 2.0, both <strong>DOS</strong> and <strong>ScummVM</strong> games downloaded via GOG are supported.
  <br>
  <br>
    These games will automatically launch using the <strong>Flatpak versions</strong> of <code>ScummVM</code> and <code>DosBox</code> once installed.
  </details>

<details class="faq-box" id="play-fortnite">
  <summary>Can I play Fortnite via Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>No.</strong> Epic Games does not support Fortnite on Linux due to anti-cheat limitations.
  <br>
  <br>
    To play Fortnite on a Steam Deck or Linux system, you will need to either:
    <ul>
      <li>Dual-boot Windows</li>
      <li>Use a cloud gaming or streaming service</li>
    </ul>

<details class="faq-box" id="play-kingdom-hearts">
  <summary>Can I play Kingdom Hearts via Junk Store?</summary>
   <p></p>
    Kingdom Hearts has known compatibility issues on Linux, and this isn't specific to Junk Store. We haven't been able to test it ourselves as we don't own a copy, so we can't provide official support or recommendations at this time.

<details class="faq-box" id="cloud-saves-support">
  <summary>Does Junk Store 2.0 support cloud saves?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Junk Store 2.0 currently offers <strong>experimental cloud save support</strong> for <strong>Epic</strong> and <strong>GOG</strong>. However, this feature is intended only for advanced users who understand and accept the risks involved — including the potential for save data loss.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Important:</strong> We do <em>not</em> offer technical support for issues related to cloud saves at this time. If you choose to enable it, please make sure you're confident in your ability to troubleshoot and back up your save data manually if needed.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Not all games from either platform support cloud saves.
</details>


<details class="faq-box" id="use-with-existing-games">
  <summary>Can I use Junk Store with games I already installed using other third-party solutions?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>No.</strong> Junk Store manages its own installations and environment. Games installed through other launchers are not recognized or managed by Junk Store.
  <br>
  <br>
      If you want to use Junk Store to manage a game, you'll need to install it again through Junk Store directly.
 </details>

<details class="faq-box" data-advanced="true" id="cheatdeck-compatibility">
  <summary>Does CheatDeck work with Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Not reliably.</strong> Epic Games launch options are very sensitive, and tools like CheatDeck often conflict with Junk Store's custom launch configuration. We've spent many hours fine-tuning this setup, so use CheatDeck at your own risk.
  <br>
  <br>
    That said, our extension scripts are user accessible and can be modified.

<details class="faq-box" id="report-bug">
