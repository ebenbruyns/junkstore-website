<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>I just signed up for the trial. How do I access Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    After installing Junk Store 2.0, you access it by pressing the <strong>Select</strong> button above the D-pad on your Steam Deck. No need to switch to Desktop Mode or launch separate applications.
  <br>
  <br>
    This opens directly in Game Mode, giving you immediate access to your Epic, GOG, and Amazon game libraries.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>What should I do first after accessing Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Generate extensions for the platforms you want to use (Epic, GOG, Amazon)<br>
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> Log into your game store accounts when prompted<br>
    <strong>Step 3:</strong> Your existing libraries will automatically sync and appear in Junk Store<br>
    <strong>Step 4:</strong> Start installing games directly from Game Mode
  <br>
  <br>
    The initial library sync can take a few minutes as Junk Store builds the database for each platform.

  <summary>What makes Junk Store different from free alternatives?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Junk Store is Steam Deck-specific software</strong> designed exclusively for handheld gaming workflows, while alternatives are general PC gaming tools adapted for Steam Deck.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Key advantages:</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>1. Controller-First Design:</strong> Every interaction optimized for D-pad/analog stick navigation - no keyboard/mouse needed
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>2. Game Mode Native:</strong> Works entirely within Game Mode - no desktop switching required to view libraries or install games
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>3. Direct Launch:</strong> Games launch directly without nested launchers - no "launcher to launch a launcher to launch your game" complexity
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>4. Unified Library:</strong> Epic, GOG, Amazon games AND emulators integrated into your Steam library as if they were native Steam games
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>5. Rapid Updates:</strong> Direct update channels mean fixes and new features roll out quickly without waiting for third-party distribution

<h2>Pricing & Value</h2>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>What makes Junk Store worth $40/year compared to free alternatives?</summary>
  <p></p>
    While Heroic is an excellent free alternative, Junk Store solves a different problem: <strong>staying in Game Mode</strong>. Here's the key difference:
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Heroic/Lutris approach:</strong> Switch to Desktop Mode ‚Üí Launch separate app ‚Üí Configure games ‚Üí Return to Game Mode
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Junk Store approach:</strong> Press Select button ‚Üí Install/launch games ‚Üí Stay in Game Mode the entire time
  <br>
  <br>
    Beyond convenience, Junk Store includes features not available in free alternatives:
    <ul>
      <li>üéÆ <strong>Game Mode native interface</strong> ‚Äî no desktop switching required</li>
      <li>üõ†Ô∏è <strong>Built-in dependency management</strong> ‚Äî Visual C++ installed automatically, other dependencies via built-in menu (no 3rd party tools needed)</li>
      <li>üíæ <strong>Unified game management</strong> ‚Äî Epic, GOG, Amazon, and emulators in one interface</li>
      <li>üß† <strong>Smart automation</strong> ‚Äî ROM downloads, artwork caching, Proton version optimization</li>
      <li>üîß <strong>Extension generator</strong> ‚Äî create custom store integrations without coding</li>
    </ul>
    If Desktop Mode workflows work for you, stick with free alternatives. If you value seamless Game Mode integration, Junk Store eliminates the friction.

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How does Junk Store's $40/year value compare to the time investment of free alternatives?</summary>
  <p></p>
    The $40/year covers three things you can't get from free alternatives:
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>1. Time savings through automation:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>One-click generation of entire game libraries (vs manual shortcuts)</li>
      <li>Automatic dependency installation (vs troubleshooting runtime errors)</li>
      <li>Built-in artwork and metadata (vs missing/broken game art)</li>
      <li>Unified interface for all stores (vs managing multiple desktop apps)</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2. Game Mode integration:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Native controller navigation ‚Äî no keyboard/mouse required</li>
      <li>Press Select to access ‚Äî no desktop mode switching</li>
      <li>Seamless Steam Deck experience ‚Äî feels like built-in functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>3. Advanced features:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Amazon Games support (not available in Heroic)</li>
      <li>Emulator integration with ROM management</li>
      <li>Custom extension generator for niche game stores</li>
      <li>Professional support and regular updates</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Value calculation:</strong> If Junk Store saves you 2 hours per month of setup/troubleshooting time, that's $1.67/hour for convenience. Most users report saving 5-10 hours monthly.

</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Can I try before I buy to see if it's worth $40?</summary>
  <p></p>

  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Trial tip:</strong> Most users know within 2-3 days whether the convenience justifies the cost. The 7-day window gives you plenty of time to test real-world usage patterns.

<h2>Using Junk Store</h2>


<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I import and play my games from the Decky version in Junk Store 2.0?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Automatic Import:</strong> This happens automatically when you first install and launch Junk Store 2.0. Once you've generated the extensions (Epic and/or GOG), your games will sync across when you open each corresponding tab.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Playing Imported Games:</strong> Yes, your games will work, but you'll need to <strong>Reset Launch Options</strong> for each game (found in the sliders menu on the game page). This only needs to be done once per game to fully migrate it to the new version.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The initial import process can take some time, as Junk Store is rebuilding the databases for each storefront.
  </details>

  <details class="faq-box">
    <summary>How do I uninstall Junk Store 2.0?</summary>
      <p></p>
        Before uninstalling, complete the migration process outlined in "How do I migrate games back to the Decky version?" below to preserve your games and saves.
      <br>
      <br>
        Once migration is complete, run the uninstall script in konsole:
        <code>~/.local/share/junkstore/uninstall.sh</code>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I migrate games back to the Decky (free) version?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>It depends on when the games were originally installed:</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>‚úÖ Games originally from Decky version:</strong> These CAN be migrated back. For already installed games, open the game page in Junk Store and use <strong>Reset Launch Options</strong> from the sliders menu. This completes the migration back to Decky compatibility.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>‚ùå Games newly installed in Junk Store 2.0:</strong> These cannot be migrated back to Decky due to different install paths and configuration systems.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>For games newly installed in 2.0 that you want to keep:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Back up your save files for any games you plan to keep playing</li>
      <li>Manually uninstall games installed via the new version before your trial expires (to free up space)</li>
      <li>Reinstall those games using the Decky version</li>
      <li>Restore your game saves manually</li>
    </ul>
     <strong>Tip:</strong> Complete this process before your trial ends ‚Äî otherwise, you may lose access and the games will still occupy storage.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I install custom Proton versions (like GE-Proton)?</summary>
  <p></p>
    To get GE-Proton or other custom Proton versions, use one of these tools:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ProtonUp-QT</strong> ‚Äî Download from the <strong>Discover Store</strong> (Desktop Mode)</li>
    <li><strong>Wine Cellar</strong> ‚Äî Install from the <strong>Decky Plugin Store</strong> (if you have Decky)</li>
  </ul>
    After installation, download the latest <strong>GE-Proton</strong> release. You can then select it as a compatibility option when changing Proton versions (see "How do I change the Proton version for a game?" below).
    <br>
    <br>
    For detailed steps, see our <a href="{{ '/plugin_tutorials/' | relative_url }}">Plugin Tutorials</a> page.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I manage game storage and SD card downloads?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Changing Download Location:</strong> You can set your preferred download location for each platform separately:
  <ul>
    <li>Go to the <strong>Epic</strong>, <strong>GOG</strong>, or <strong>Amazon</strong> tab</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>‚öôÔ∏è Gear icon</strong> to open settings</li>
    <li>Set your desired download path (e.g. your SD card directory)</li>
    <li>Press <kbd>X</kbd> to save your changes</li>
    <li>Repeat for each platform you want to configure</li>
  </ul>
    <strong>Moving Existing Games:</strong> Not currently supported. Moving installed games to SD card is a complex feature on our development roadmap. For now, games need to be stored on internal storage or an already-mounted drive.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I install or uninstall a game?</summary>
  <p></p>
  <strong>To install a game in Junk Store:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the game‚Äôs page in Junk Store and click install.</li>
    <li>Remember to stay on the game page until installation is complete.</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>To uninstall a game in Junk Store:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the game's page in Junk Store.</li>
    <li>Open the <strong>‚ò∞ Slider menu</strong> and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li>
    <li>
      Manually delete any leftover files to free up space:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Epic:</strong> <code>~/Games/epic</code> or <code>/*your-SD-card*/Games/epic</code></li>
        <li><strong>GOG:</strong> <code>~/Games/gog</code> or <code>/*your-SD-card*/Games/gog</code></li>
        <li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <code>~/Games/amazon</code> or <code>/*your-SD-card*/Games/amazon</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Uninstalling removes all local save data. To back up saves first, see "How do I find save data for my games?" below.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I find save data for my games?</summary>
  <p></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Find the game's <strong>Steam ID</strong> at the bottom of its page in Junk Store.
    </li>
    <li>
      Navigate to the following path on your Steam Deck:<br>
      <code>~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/&lt;SteamID&gt;/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      From there, follow the path used by your game. Here are some examples:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Epic example:</strong> <code>Local Settings/Application Data/Dying Light/Saved</code></li>
        <li><strong>GOG example:</strong> <code>AppData/Roaming/Lonely Troops/Hero of the Kingdom II</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
    Each game may store saves in slightly different locations depending on how it was packaged or ported. Look under <code>AppData</code>, <code>Local Settings</code>, or <code>Documents</code> within the Steam compatibility prefix.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Do games requiring third-party launchers (EA, Ubisoft, etc.) work with Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>EA Games:</strong> No, EA games are not supported. They require the EA Launcher, which isn't integrated with Junk Store. EA titles will not appear in your Epic Games library when accessed through Junk Store.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Ubisoft Games:</strong> It's complicated. Some Ubisoft titles appear in your Epic library, while others don't. The Ubisoft Launcher is not officially supported, but some users have successfully installed it manually and run select games.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Other Third-Party Launchers:</strong> Not currently supported. While Legendary has limited support, this feature isn't implemented in Junk Store yet. You can attempt manual setup via CLI or modify the extension script.

  <summary>Is Junk Store trustworthy and how are my credentials handled?</summary>
    <p></p>
    <strong>Developer Credentials:</strong> Yes, Junk Store is trustworthy. It's developed by a cybersecurity expert and white-hat professional. You can verify our lead developer's credentials on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eben-bruyns/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Privacy & Security:</strong> We take user privacy and security seriously ‚Äî nothing is stored, tracked, or transmitted beyond what is absolutely required for Junk Store to function properly.
  <br>
  <br>

  <summary>Does Junk Store 2.0 support cloud saves?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Junk Store 2.0 currently offers <strong>experimental cloud save support</strong> for <strong>Epic</strong> and <strong>GOG</strong>. However, this feature is intended only for advanced users who understand and accept the risks involved ‚Äî including the potential for save data loss.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Important:</strong> We do <em>not</em> offer technical support for issues related to cloud saves at this time. If you choose to enable it, please make sure you're confident in your ability to troubleshoot and back up your save data manually if needed.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Not all games from either platform support cloud saves.
</details>


<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Can I use Junk Store with games I already installed using other third-party solutions?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>No.</strong> Junk Store manages its own installations and environment. Games installed through other launchers are not recognized or managed by Junk Store.
  <br>
  <br>
      If you want to use Junk Store to manage a game, you'll need to install it again through Junk Store directly.
 </details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Does CheatDeck work with Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Not reliably.</strong> Epic Games launch options are very sensitive, and tools like CheatDeck often conflict with Junk Store's custom launch configuration. We've spent many hours fine-tuning this setup, so use CheatDeck at your own risk.
  <br>
  <br>
    That said, our extension scripts are user accessible and can be modified.
