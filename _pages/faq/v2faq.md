This is the official Junk Store FAQ, where you'll find answers to the most commonly asked questions. We update this page regularly as new features roll out and feedback comes in.
  
For more help, drop by the [r/JunkStore subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkStore/) or join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6mRUhR6Teh).


<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>I just signed up for the trial. How do I access Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    After installing Junk Store 2.0, you access it by pressing the <strong>Select</strong> button above the D-pad on your Steam Deck. No need to switch to Desktop Mode or launch separate applications.
  <br>
  <br>
    This opens directly in Game Mode, giving you immediate access to your Epic, GOG, and Amazon game libraries.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>What should I do first after accessing Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Generate extensions for the platforms you want to use (Epic, GOG, Amazon)<br>
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> Log into your game store accounts when prompted<br>
    <strong>Step 3:</strong> Your existing libraries will automatically sync and appear in Junk Store<br>
    <strong>Step 4:</strong> Start installing games directly from Game Mode
  <br>
  <br>
    The initial library sync can take a few minutes as Junk Store builds the database for each platform.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>What makes Junk Store different from free alternatives?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>The key difference:</strong> Junk Store works entirely within Game Mode. Free alternatives require launching separate desktop applications to view libraries and install games.
  <br>
  <br>
    With Junk Store, your entire Epic, GOG, and Amazon libraries are visible directly in Game Mode without opening any external apps. This eliminates the friction of switching between interfaces just to manage your games.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How long is my trial and what happens when it ends?</summary>
  <p></p>
    You get <strong>7 days free</strong> to try all features. During the trial, you have full access to Epic, GOG, Amazon integration, emulators, ROM support, and all premium features.
  <br>
  <br>
    After 7 days, if you don't subscribe, you'll lose access to Junk Store's interface but your installed games remain playable through Steam. You can reactivate anytime to restore full functionality.
</details>


<h2>Pricing & Value</h2>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Why pay $40 when Heroic Games Launcher is free?</summary>
  <p></p>
    While Heroic is an excellent free alternative, Junk Store solves a different problem: <strong>staying in Game Mode</strong>. Here's the key difference:
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Heroic/Lutris approach:</strong> Switch to Desktop Mode → Launch separate app → Configure games → Return to Game Mode
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Junk Store approach:</strong> Press Select button → Install/launch games → Stay in Game Mode the entire time
  <br>
  <br>
    Beyond convenience, Junk Store includes features not available in free alternatives:
    <ul>
      <li>🎮 <strong>Game Mode native interface</strong> — no desktop switching required</li>
      <li>⚡ <strong>One-click library generation</strong> — automatically creates Steam shortcuts for 1000+ games</li>
      <li>🛠️ <strong>Built-in dependency management</strong> — handles Visual C++ redistributables, .NET frameworks automatically</li>
      <li>💾 <strong>Unified game management</strong> — Epic, GOG, Amazon, and emulators in one interface</li>
      <li>🧠 <strong>Smart automation</strong> — ROM downloads, artwork caching, Proton version optimization</li>
      <li>🔧 <strong>Extension generator</strong> — create custom store integrations without coding</li>
    </ul>
    If Desktop Mode workflows work for you, stick with free alternatives. If you value seamless Game Mode integration, Junk Store eliminates the friction.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>What makes Junk Store worth $40/year vs free alternatives?</summary>
  <p></p>
    The $40/year covers three things you can't get from free alternatives:
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>1. Time savings through automation:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>One-click generation of entire game libraries (vs manual shortcuts)</li>
      <li>Automatic dependency installation (vs troubleshooting runtime errors)</li>
      <li>Built-in artwork and metadata (vs missing/broken game art)</li>
      <li>Unified interface for all stores (vs managing multiple desktop apps)</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2. Game Mode integration:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Native controller navigation — no keyboard/mouse required</li>
      <li>Press Select to access — no desktop mode switching</li>
      <li>Seamless Steam Deck experience — feels like built-in functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>3. Advanced features:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Amazon Games support (not available in Heroic)</li>
      <li>Emulator integration with ROM management</li>
      <li>Custom extension generator for niche game stores</li>
      <li>Professional support and regular updates</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Value calculation:</strong> If Junk Store saves you 2 hours per month of setup/troubleshooting time, that's $1.67/hour for convenience. Most users report saving 5-10 hours monthly.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How much time does Junk Store actually save vs manual setup?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Based on user feedback, here's the typical time investment comparison:
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Manual setup with free alternatives:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>⏱️ <strong>Initial setup:</strong> 2-4 hours (installing Heroic/Lutris, configuring stores, learning interfaces)</li>
      <li>⏱️ <strong>Per game setup:</strong> 15-30 minutes (creating shortcuts, troubleshooting dependencies, fixing artwork)</li>
      <li>⏱️ <strong>Ongoing maintenance:</strong> 1-2 hours monthly (updates, fixes, new game setup)</li>
      <li>⏱️ <strong>Desktop Mode transitions:</strong> 2-3 minutes per session (adds up quickly)</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Junk Store setup:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>⏱️ <strong>Initial setup:</strong> 15-30 minutes (download, generate extensions, login to stores)</li>
      <li>⏱️ <strong>Per game setup:</strong> 30 seconds (click install, automatic Steam shortcut creation)</li>
      <li>⏱️ <strong>Ongoing maintenance:</strong> 5-10 minutes monthly (automatic updates)</li>
      <li>⏱️ <strong>Access time:</strong> 2 seconds (press Select button)</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Realistic monthly time savings:</strong> 3-6 hours for active users, 1-2 hours for casual users.
  <br>
  <br>
    Beyond time, users consistently mention <strong>reduced frustration</strong> and <strong>lower technical barriers</strong> as major value factors.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Is the premium version really that different from free alternatives?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Yes, it's architected completely differently. Free alternatives are <strong>desktop applications</strong> designed for traditional PC gaming. Junk Store is a <strong>Game Mode native tool</strong> designed specifically for Steam Deck workflows.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Architectural differences:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>🎮 <strong>Controller-first design</strong> — every interaction optimized for D-pad/analog stick navigation</li>
      <li>⚡ <strong>Steam integration</strong> — generates shortcuts automatically, handles compatibility layers natively</li>
      <li>🔄 <strong>Unified backend</strong> — single interface manages multiple store APIs simultaneously</li>
      <li>🧠 <strong>Automation engine</strong> — handles dependencies, artwork, metadata without user intervention</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Feature differences:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>📦 <strong>Amazon Games support</strong> — not available in Heroic/Lutris</li>
      <li>🎯 <strong>ROM management</strong> — integrated emulator setup with automatic downloads</li>
      <li>🛠️ <strong>Extension system</strong> — create custom store integrations via generator</li>
      <li>☁️ <strong>Experimental cloud saves</strong> — Epic/GOG sync without desktop apps</li>
      <li>📊 <strong>Performance optimization</strong> — handles 1000+ games per tab efficiently</li>
    </ul>
    Think of it as <strong>Steam Deck-specific software</strong> vs <strong>general PC gaming tools</strong>. Both solve game access, but for very different use cases.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>What happens if I don't renew my subscription?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Your games remain installed and playable, but you lose access to Junk Store's management features:
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>What continues working:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ All installed games remain playable through Steam</li>
      <li>✅ Steam shortcuts continue functioning normally</li>
      <li>✅ Save files are preserved</li>
      <li>✅ Proton compatibility settings maintained</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>What stops working:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>❌ Installing new games through Junk Store</li>
      <li>❌ Updating existing games via Junk Store</li>
      <li>❌ Managing game settings/dependencies</li>
      <li>❌ Accessing Junk Store interface (reverts to "trial expired" message)</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Migration options:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>🔄 Switch to free Decky plugin version (Epic only, limited features)</li>
      <li>🖥️ Use Heroic/Lutris in Desktop Mode for new installs</li>
      <li>💳 Reactivate subscription anytime to restore full functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Important:</strong> If switching away from Junk Store 2.0, see "How do I migrate games back to the Decky version?" below for complete backup and migration steps.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Can I try before I buy to see if it's worth $40?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Absolutely.</strong> Every Junk Store subscription includes a <strong>7-day free trial</strong> with full access to all features:
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Trial includes:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Full Epic, GOG, and Amazon Games integration</li>
      <li>✅ Emulator setup and ROM management</li>
      <li>✅ Extension generator and custom store creation</li>
      <li>✅ All premium features (cloud saves, dependencies, automation)</li>
      <li>✅ Technical support via Discord</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Trial recommendations:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>🎯 Test with your existing game library — generate extensions for your owned games</li>
      <li>⚡ Try the automation features — let Junk Store set up several games automatically</li>
      <li>🎮 Use it exclusively in Game Mode — experience the workflow difference</li>
      <li>🔧 Experiment with advanced features — dependencies, custom extensions, emulators</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>No commitment:</strong> Cancel anytime during trial period for zero charges. If you cancel, you can still access the free Decky version for basic Epic Games support.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Trial tip:</strong> Most users know within 2-3 days whether the convenience justifies the cost. The 7-day window gives you plenty of time to test real-world usage patterns.

<h2>Using Junk Store</h2>


<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I import my installed games from the Decky version of Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    This is done automatically when you first install and launch Junk Store 2.0. Once you’ve generated the extensions (Epic and/or GOG), your games will sync across when you open each corresponding tab.
  <br>
  <br>
    Please note that this process can take some time, as Junk Store is rebuilding the databases for each storefront.
  </details>

  <details class="faq-box">
    <summary>How do I uninstall Junk Store 2.0?</summary>
      <p></p>
        Before uninstalling, complete the migration process outlined in "How do I migrate games back to the Decky version?" below to preserve your games and saves.
      <br>
      <br>
        Once migration is complete, run the uninstall script in konsole:
        <code>~/.local/share/junkstore/uninstall.sh</code>
  </details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I install custom Proton versions (like GE-Proton)?</summary>
  <p></p>
    To get GE-Proton or other custom Proton versions, use one of these tools:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ProtonUp-QT</strong> — Download from the <strong>Discover Store</strong> (Desktop Mode)</li>
    <li><strong>Wine Cellar</strong> — Install from the <strong>Decky Plugin Store</strong> (if you have Decky)</li>
  </ul>
    After installation, download the latest <strong>GE-Proton</strong> release. You can then select it as a compatibility option when changing Proton versions (see "How do I change the Proton version for a game?" below).
    <br>
    <br>
    For detailed steps, see our <a href="{{ '/plugin_tutorials/' | relative_url }}">Plugin Tutorials</a> page.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I change where games are downloaded?</summary>
  <p></p>
    You can set your preferred download location from the Epic tab:
  <ul>
    <li>Go to the <strong>Epic</strong> tab</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>⚙️ Gear icon</strong> to open settings</li>
    <li>Set your desired download path (e.g. your SD card directory)</li>
    <li>Press <kbd>X</kbd> to save your changes.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Can I move games to my SD card?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Not at the moment. It’s a complex feature and on our development roadmap. For now, games need to be stored on internal storage or an already-mounted drive.  
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I install or uninstall a game?</summary>
  <p></p>
  <strong>To install a game in Junk Store:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the game’s page in Junk Store and click install.</li>
    <li>Remember to stay on the game page until installation is complete.</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>To uninstall a game in Junk Store:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the game's page in Junk Store.</li>
    <li>Open the <strong>☰ Slider menu</strong> and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li>
    <li>
      Manually delete any leftover files to free up space:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Epic:</strong> <code>~/Games/epic</code> or <code>/*your-SD-card*/Games/epic</code></li>
        <li><strong>GOG:</strong> <code>~/Games/gog</code> or <code>/*your-SD-card*/Games/gog</code></li>
        <li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <code>~/Games/amazon</code> or <code>/*your-SD-card*/Games/amazon</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Uninstalling removes all local save data. To back up saves first, see "How do I find save data for my games?" below.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I find save data for my games?</summary>
  <p></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Find the game's <strong>Steam ID</strong> at the bottom of its page in Junk Store.
    </li>
    <li>
      Navigate to the following path on your Steam Deck:<br>
      <code>~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/&lt;SteamID&gt;/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      From there, follow the path used by your game. Here are some examples:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Epic example:</strong> <code>Local Settings/Application Data/Dying Light/Saved</code></li>
        <li><strong>GOG example:</strong> <code>AppData/Roaming/Lonely Troops/Hero of the Kingdom II</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
    Each game may store saves in slightly different locations depending on how it was packaged or ported. Look under <code>AppData</code>, <code>Local Settings</code>, or <code>Documents</code> within the Steam compatibility prefix.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I change the Proton version for a game?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>From Junk Store:</strong> Press <code>Y</code> to open the Steam shortcut, then click the gear icon ⚙️ → <strong>Properties</strong> → <strong>Compatibility</strong>.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>From Steam Library:</strong> Highlight the game, press the <strong>Start/Options</strong> button → <strong>Properties</strong> → <strong>Compatibility</strong>.
  <br>
  <br>
    Select your desired Proton version and relaunch the game. If you need custom versions like GE-Proton, see "How do I install custom Proton versions?" above.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>I want to change the FPS for a game. How do I do this in Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Just like with regular Steam games, you can change the FPS cap through the Quick Access Menu (QAM).
    <ul> 
      <li>Hit the <strong>three-dot button</strong> on your Deck to open the QAM</li>
      <li>Scroll to the performance tab</li>
      <li>Adjust the FPS, TDP, refresh rate, or any other performance settings from there.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I migrate games back to the Decky (free) version?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>It depends on when the games were originally installed:</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>✅ Games originally from Decky version:</strong> These CAN be migrated back. For already installed games, open the game page in Junk Store and use <strong>Reset Launch Options</strong> from the sliders menu. This completes the migration back to Decky compatibility.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>❌ Games newly installed in Junk Store 2.0:</strong> These cannot be migrated back to Decky due to different install paths and configuration systems.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>For games newly installed in 2.0 that you want to keep:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Back up your save files for any games you plan to keep playing</li>
      <li>Manually uninstall games installed via the new version before your trial expires (to free up space)</li>
      <li>Reinstall those games using the Decky version</li>
      <li>Restore your game saves manually</li>
    </ul>
     <strong>Tip:</strong> Complete this process before your trial ends — otherwise, you may lose access and the games will still occupy storage.
</details>

<h2>Game Compatibility & Support</h2>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Do EA and Ubisoft games work via Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>EA Games:</strong><br>
    No, EA games are not supported. They require the EA Launcher, which isn’t integrated with Junk Store. Because of this, EA titles will not appear in your Epic Games library when accessed through Junk Store.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Ubisoft Games:</strong><br>
    It’s complicated. Some Ubisoft titles do appear in your Epic library, while others don’t. The Ubisoft Launcher is not officially supported, but we—and some users—have successfully installed it manually and run select games through Junk Store.
  <!-- <ul>
    <li>A full guide is available here: <a href="/tutorials/Ubisoft/">How to install Ubisoft via Junk Store</a></li>
  </ul> -->
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Does the GOG extension support DOS and ScummVM games?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Yes.</strong> In Junk Store 2.0, both <strong>DOS</strong> and <strong>ScummVM</strong> games downloaded via GOG are supported.
  <br>
  <br>
    These games will automatically launch using the <strong>Flatpak versions</strong> of <code>ScummVM</code> and <code>DosBox</code> once installed.
  </details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Can I play Fortnite via Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>No.</strong> Epic Games does not support Fortnite on Linux due to anti-cheat limitations.
  <br>
  <br>
    To play Fortnite on a Steam Deck or Linux system, you will need to either:
    <ul>
      <li>Dual-boot Windows</li>
      <li>Use a cloud gaming or streaming service</li>
    </ul>
    More info: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923163/fortnite-steam-deck-update-epic-tim-sweeney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge article</a>
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Can I play Kingdom Hearts via Junk Store?</summary>
   <p></p>
    Kingdom Hearts has known compatibility issues on Linux, and this isn’t specific to Junk Store. We haven’t been able to test it ourselves as we don’t own a copy, so we can’t provide official support or recommendations at this time.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Do games that require third-party launchers work?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Not currently. While Legendary has limited support, this feature isn't implemented in Junk Store yet. You can attempt manual setup via CLI or modify the extension script.
</details>

<h2>General/Technical Details</h2>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>What's the difference between the Decky version and the Paid version?</summary>
  <p>
    The Decky version is free and open source, designed to run via the Decky Loader. The Paid version includes extra convenience features and doesn't require Decky to run.

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Is Junk Store trustworthy?</summary>
    <p></p>
    Yes. Junk Store is developed by a cybersecurity expert and white-hat professional. You can verify our lead developer's credentials on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eben-bruyns/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
    We take user privacy and security seriously — nothing is stored, tracked, or transmitted beyond what is absolutely required for Junk Store to function properly.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Does Junk Store store any of my credentials?</summary>
  <p></p>
    No. Junk Store does not store any of your credentials. This works the same way as in the open-source Decky Plugin version of Junk Store.
  <br>
  <br>
    All authentication is handled via OAuth tokens. The only token managed directly by Junk Store is the Junk Store token. Other tokens are managed by external tools: Legendary (Epic), lgogdownloader (Gog), and Nile (Amazon).
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Does Junk Store 2.0 support cloud saves?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Junk Store 2.0 currently offers <strong>experimental cloud save support</strong> for <strong>Epic</strong> and <strong>GOG</strong>. However, this feature is intended only for advanced users who understand and accept the risks involved — including the potential for save data loss.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Important:</strong> We do <em>not</em> offer technical support for issues related to cloud saves at this time. If you choose to enable it, please make sure you're confident in your ability to troubleshoot and back up your save data manually if needed.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Not all games from either platform support cloud saves.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Will I be able to play my games installed from the Decky version in the new version?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Yes. However, you'll need to <strong>Reset Launch Options</strong> for each game. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This only needs to be done once per game to fully migrate it to the new version of Junk Store.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Can I use Junk Store with games I already installed using other third-party solutions?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>No.</strong> Junk Store manages its own installations and environment. Games installed through other launchers (like Heroic, Lutris, or Bottles) are not recognized or managed by Junk Store.

      If you want to use Junk Store to manage a game, you'll need to install it again through Junk Store directly.

  <summary>Does CheatDeck work with Junk Store?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Not reliably.</strong> Epic Games launch options are very sensitive, and tools like CheatDeck often conflict with Junk Store's custom launch configuration. We've spent many hours fine-tuning this setup, so use CheatDeck at your own risk.

  <br>
    That said, our extension scripts are user accessible and can be modified.
