  <summary>What's the difference between the Decky version and the Paid version?</summary>
  <p></p>
    The Decky version is free and open source, designed to run via the Decky Loader. The Paid version includes extra convenience features and doesn't require Decky to run.

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I install the Junk Store Decky plugin?</summary>
  <p></p>
    The Junk Store Decky plugin requires <strong>Decky Loader</strong> to be installed first on your Steam Deck.
  <br>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>Install Decky Loader by following the <a href="https://decky.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Decky installation guide</a></li>
    <li>Once Decky is installed, access the Decky Plugin Store from your Quick Access Menu</li>
    <li>Search for "Junk Store" and install the plugin</li>
    <li>The plugin will appear in your Decky menu after installation</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <br>
    For detailed instructions, visit our <a href="{{ '/deckyhelp' | relative_url }}">Decky Plugin Help</a> page.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I access Junk Store after installation?</summary>
  <p></p>
    After installing the Decky plugin, access Junk Store through the <strong>Decky Loader menu</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>Press the <strong>three-dot button</strong> (Quick Access Menu) on your Steam Deck</li>
    <li>Look for the <strong>Decky</strong> icon in the menu</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Junk Store</strong> from the plugin list</li>
  </ul>
    The plugin opens directly in Game Mode without requiring Desktop Mode switching.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>What should I do first after installing the Decky plugin?</summary>
  <p></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open Junk Store from the Decky menu</li>
    <li>Go to the <strong>Epic</strong> tab and log into your Epic Games account</li>
    <li>Your Epic Games library will automatically sync and appear</li>
    <li>(Optional) Install the GOG extension if you want GOG game support</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The initial library sync can take a few minutes as Junk Store builds the database for your games.
  <br>
  <br>
    For GOG support, you'll need to purchase the GOG extension separately from the <a href="https://portal.junkstore.xyz/" target="_blank">Junk Store Portal</a>.
</details>

<details class="faq-box" id="games-missing-a-through-l">
  <summary>Why can I only see games A-L in my Epic/GOG library?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>This is normal behavior for the Decky plugin.</strong> The free Decky version only loads your first 100 games by default for performance optimization.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>To see your full library:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Open your Epic or GOG library in Junk Store</li>
      <li>Navigate to any game in the list (move out of the search field)</li>
      <li>Look for the bottom menu with <strong>"SHOW ALL"</strong> button</li>
      <li>Press the <strong>Y button</strong> on your Steam Deck</li>
      <li>Wait a moment for your complete library to load</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>Can't see the "SHOW ALL" button?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Your CSS Loader theme might be hiding the bottom menu</li>
      <li>Try temporarily disabling your CSS theme to access the button</li>
      <li>You can still search for specific games by name</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Each store (Epic, GOG, Amazon) needs "SHOW ALL" pressed separately.

</div>

<div class="gog-extension-info">
  <p>GOG extension updates are now exclusively available through the Junk Store portal. This change makes it faster for us to deliver updates and much easier for you to download and install them.</p>
  
  <p>Once you've purchased access, please follow the <a href="/tutorials/gogextension">GOG Extension Install Guide</a> to install the extension and link it to your Junk Store plugin.</p>

  <p style="border-left: 4px solid #e67300; background-color: #1f1f1f; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">
    <strong>Note:</strong> The GOG extension is currently in <strong>maintenance-only</strong> mode. This means we'll continue fixing bugs and ensuring compatibility, but we're not actively adding new features. Continued support depends on user interest and purchases.

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Where can I find the GOG extension?</summary>
  <p></p>
    It is exclusively available through the Junk Store portal. You can purchase access there with a one-time payment from the <a href="https://portal.junkstore.xyz/" target="_blank">Junk Store Portal</a>.<br><br>
    Once you have it, you have it. We can't take away GOG functionality/integration with the Junk Store plugin. All funds go back into the enhancement and development of Junk Store.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Why isn't GOG free to use?</summary>
  <p></p>
    GOG support is available to paid supporters, and while we'd love to offer it for free, there's a lot of behind-the-scenes work and resources involved in creating and maintaining Junk Store. We appreciate your understanding and support as we continue to improve and expand Junk Store. All funds go back into the enhancement and development of Junk Store.
</details>



<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Does the GOG extension support DOS and ScummVM games?</summary>
  <p></p>
     <strong>No.</strong> DOS games and some ScummVM titles are not supported by the GOG extension in the Decky version of Junk Store.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Does the GOG extension support native Linux games?</summary>
  <p></p>
    No ‚Äî the GOG extension is designed for Windows games running through Proton. Native Linux games from GOG are not currently supported, as Junk Store relies on Proton's compatibility layer for game execution and integration.
</details>



<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Can I use the GOG extension with games I already installed using other third-party solutions?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>No.</strong> Junk Store manages its own installations and environment. Games installed through other launchers (like Heroic, Lutris, or Bottles) are not recognized or managed by the GOG extension.
  <br>
  <br>
      If you want to use the GOG extension to manage a game, you'll need to install it again through Junk Store directly.

<div class="section-summary">
  <h3>Game Management - <span class="question-count">10 Questions</span></h3>
  <p>Installation, uninstallation, save data, storage, Proton versions, and best practices.</p>
</div>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I install or uninstall a game?</summary>
  <p></p>
  <strong>To install a game in Junk Store:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the game's page in Junk Store and click install.</li>
    <li>Remember to stay on the game page until installation is complete.</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>To uninstall a game in Junk Store:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the game's page in Junk Store.</li>
    <li>
      Open the <strong>‚ò∞ Slider menu</strong> and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br>
      <em>Note:</em> You may want to write down the game's SteamID so you can locate it later in your <code>compatdata</code> and <code>shadercache</code> folders.
    </li>
    <li>
      Manually delete any leftover files to free up space or completely remove the game:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Epic:</strong> <code>~/Games/epic</code> or <code>/*your-SD-card*/Games/epic</code></li>
        <li><strong>GOG:</strong> <code>~/Games/gog</code> or <code>/*your-SD-card*/Games/gog</code></li>
      </ul>
      Once you have located the games folder you can delete any remaining game files/data.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Uninstalling a game will remove all local save data. Be sure to back up your saves first if you want to keep them.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I find save data for my games?</summary>
  <p></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Find the game's <strong>Steam ID</strong> at the bottom of its page in Junk Store.
    </li>
    <li>
      Navigate to the following path on your Steam Deck:<br>
      <code>~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/&lt;SteamID&gt;/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      From there, follow the path used by your game. Here are some examples:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Epic example:</strong> <code>Local Settings/Application Data/Dying Light/Saved</code></li>
        <li><strong>GOG example:</strong> <code>AppData/Roaming/Lonely Troops/Hero of the Kingdom II</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
    Each game may store saves in slightly different locations depending on how it was packaged or ported. Look under <code>AppData</code>, <code>Local Settings</code>, or <code>Documents</code> within the Steam compatibility prefix.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I change where games are downloaded?</summary>
  <p></p>
    You can set your preferred download location from the Epic tab:
  <ol>
    <li>Go to the <strong>Epic</strong> tab</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>‚öôÔ∏è Gear icon</strong> to open settings</li>
    <li>Set your desired download path (e.g. your SD card directory)</li>
    <li>Press <kbd>X</kbd> to save your changes</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>For GOG games:</strong> Similar process but from the GOG extension interface after installation.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Can I move games to my SD card?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Not at the moment. It's a complex feature and on our development roadmap. For now, games need to be stored on internal storage or an already-mounted drive.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Workaround:</strong> Set your download location to your SD card before installing new games.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I change the Proton version for a game?</summary>
  <p></p>
    You can do this from either your Steam Library or directly inside Junk Store.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>From Junk Store:</strong><br>
    Press <code>Y</code> to open the Steam shortcut.
    <ol>
      <li>Click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí <strong>Properties</strong> ‚Üí <strong>Compatibility</strong></li>
      <li>Select the Proton version you want to use</li>
      <li>Relaunch the game</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>From Steam Library:</strong><br>
  <ol>
      <li>Highlight the game and press the <strong>Start/Options</strong> button (the one with three lines)</li>
      <li>Go to <strong>Properties</strong> ‚Üí <strong>Compatibility</strong></li>
      <li>Select the Proton version you want to use</li>
      <li>Relaunch the game</li>
    </ol>
    Once you've selected a version, back out to the game screen and hit <strong>Play</strong>.
  <br>
  <br>

</details>


<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Can I use Junk Store with games I already installed using other third-party solutions?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>No.</strong> Junk Store manages its own installations and environment. Games installed through other launchers (like Heroic, Lutris, or Bottles) are not recognized or managed by Junk Store.
  <br>
  <br>
      If you want to use Junk Store to manage a game, you'll need to install it again through Junk Store directly.
 </details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Does Junk Store support cloud saves?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>No, cloud saves are not supported.</strong> We don't want users to run the risk of losing their game saves.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Technical details:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Epic Games:</strong> While Legendary supports this, we haven't implemented it due to potential data loss risks</li>
    <li><strong>GOG Games:</strong> Not implemented as it isn't a trivial problem to solve and requires more resources than currently available</li>
    <li><strong>Manual configuration:</strong> Tech-savvy users can manually configure via CLI, but it's not recommended</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Does Junk Store automatically install DLC content?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Yes, DLC is installed automatically by default.</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Platform details:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Epic Games:</strong> DLC is installed automatically by default</li>
    <li><strong>GOG Games:</strong> DLC content is automatically installed by default</li>
  </ul>
    <strong>Known limitations:</strong> 
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Epic Games:</strong> Ideally, all Epic DLCs should download automatically, but not all games handle them the same way. It really depends on how the developers packaged the content, and unfortunately, the current plugin solution doesn't catch every scenario</li>
    <li><strong>GOG Games:</strong> We have identified some GOG games that require GOG Galaxy to be installed in order to access the DLC</li>
  </ul>
    We're aware of these limitations, but right now we don't have the resources to fully address them.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Do I need to keep Junk Store open while downloading games?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Yes.</strong> Junk Store doesn't have a background download queue. If you close or leave the plugin, your download may stop or behave unpredictably.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>This applies to both:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Epic Games:</strong> Stay on the game page until installation is complete</li>
    <li><strong>GOG Games:</strong> Keep the plugin open during downloads</li>
  </ul>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Stay on the game page until installation is complete to ensure reliable downloads.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>What are some general usage tips and best practices?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>How games integrate:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Games appear in your Steam library as non-Steam games</li>
    <li>Use Steam's built-in features (Big Picture, controller configs, etc.)</li>
    <li>Performance settings work the same as regular Steam games</li>
    <li>Steam Deck sleep/resume functionality works normally</li>
  </ul>
    <strong>Best practices:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep Junk Store open during downloads (no background queue)</li>
    <li>Back up save files before uninstalling games</li>
    <li>Use custom Proton versions (like GE-Proton) for better compatibility</li>
    <li>Set download locations to SD card to save internal storage</li>
    <li>Write down Steam IDs before uninstalling (for save data recovery)</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>How do I change the FPS or performance settings for games?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Just like with regular Steam games, you can change the FPS cap and other performance settings through the Quick Access Menu (QAM).
    <ul> 
      <li>Hit the <strong>three-dot button</strong> on your Deck to open the QAM</li>
      <li>Scroll to the performance tab</li>
      <li>Adjust the FPS, TDP, refresh rate, or any other performance settings from there</li>
    </ul>
    This works for both Epic and GOG games since they're integrated as Steam shortcuts.
</details>

<h2 id="game-compatibility">Game Compatibility</h2>

<div class="section-summary">
  <h3>Game Compatibility - <span class="question-count">4 Questions</span></h3>
  <p>Third-party launchers, anti-cheat systems, specific games, and tool integration.</p>
</div>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Do games requiring third-party launchers (EA, Ubisoft, etc.) work?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>Generally not supported.</strong> While Legendary has limited support for third-party launchers, this feature isn't implemented in Junk Store yet.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>EA Games:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>‚ùå <strong>Not supported</strong> - Require EA Launcher/Origin integration</li>
      <li>EA titles will not appear in your Epic Games library through Junk Store</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Ubisoft Games:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Mixed support</strong> - Some appear in Epic library, others don't</li>
      <li>Ubisoft Connect launcher not officially supported</li>
      <li>Some users have manually installed Ubisoft Connect and run select games</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Other affected games:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Games with custom launchers or activation systems</li>
      <li>Titles requiring additional DRM verification</li>
      <li>Games that need launcher-specific features</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Workarounds:</strong> Advanced users can attempt manual setup via CLI or modify extension scripts, but this requires technical knowledge and isn't officially supported.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>What about games with anti-cheat systems (including Fortnite)?</summary>
  <p></p>
    <strong>General Anti-Cheat Compatibility:</strong> Most games with BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) that work on Steam Deck should also work through Junk Store, since they use the same Proton compatibility layer.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Known Working:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Games with Steam-verified anti-cheat support typically work fine</li>
    <li>Most BattlEye and EAC games function normally through Junk Store</li>
  </ul>
    <strong>Known Issues:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Some anti-cheat systems may not recognize non-Steam game launches</li>
    <li>Newer or more restrictive anti-cheat systems may cause problems</li>
  </ul>
    <strong>‚ùå Fortnite Specifically:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Does not work</strong> - Epic Games does not support Fortnite on Linux due to anti-cheat policy</li>
    <li>This is Epic's decision, not a Junk Store limitation</li>
    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Dual-boot Windows or use cloud gaming services</li>
    <li>More info: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923163/fortnite-steam-deck-update-epic-tim-sweeney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge article</a></li>
  </ul>
    <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Check <a href="https://www.protondb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProtonDB</a> for compatibility reports specific to your anti-cheat games before installing.
</details>

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Can I play Kingdom Hearts via Junk Store?</summary>
   <p></p>
    Kingdom Hearts has known compatibility issues on Linux, and this isn't specific to Junk Store.
    <br>
    <br>
    We haven't been able to test it ourselves as we don't own a copy, so we can't provide official support or recommendations at this time.
</details>


<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>Does CheatDeck work with Junk Store?</summary>
  <p> </p>
    Not reliably. Epic game launch options are very sensitive, and tools like CheatDeck can conflict with Junk Store's configuration. We've spent over 100 hours fine-tuning this ‚Äî so use with caution.
  <br>
  <br>
    That said, our extension scripts are open and easier to modify than the plugin core. If you want to experiment and send a working pull request, we're happy to review it!
