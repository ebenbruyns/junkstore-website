This section deals with any problems specific to GOG integration — from download issues to getting games to run smoothly through Junk Store.

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>I can't get GOG to run in Junk Store.</summary>
  <p></p>
    Make sure you're using the <strong>latest version of Junk Store</strong> from the <strong>Decky Testing Store</strong>.<br><br>
    You’ll also need to reinstall dependencies by going to the <strong>About</strong> section and clicking “Install Dependencies.”<br><br>
    If you've purchased the GOG extension, <strong>follow the setup instructions emailed to you</strong> or refer to the downloadable PDF — skipping these steps may cause issues.

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>I don’t see any games in my Gog library.</summary>
  <p></p>
  Check the following:
  <ul>
    <li>If you have more than one Gog account, make sure you are logged into the correct one.</li>
    <li>Press <strong>X</strong> to toggle the “Show Installed” filter — it may be hiding your uninstalled games.</li>
    <li>Clear the search bar at the top — any text here will filter your library.</li>
    <li>Refresh your games list from the main Gog tab:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Sliders menu &gt; Refresh Games List</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Reboot the Steam Deck</li>
    <li>Log out and log back into your Gog account</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>Having issues bringing up the keyboard in Game Mode?</summary>
  <p></p>
    If the <strong>Steam + X</strong> shortcut isn’t bringing up the keyboard try the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Try to bring up the keyboard ⌨️ from the Quick Access Menu (<strong>⋯</strong>).</li>
    <li>Tap directly on a text field (like a password box) to prompt the keyboard.</li>
    <li>Try toggling to Desktop Mode and back to Game Mode to reset input services.</li>
    <li>Restart Steam or the device if the issue persists.</li>
  </ul>
    This is a known Steam bug that has been around for a while. These steps usually help work around it until Valve fixes it in a future update.
