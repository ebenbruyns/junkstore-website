Issues with Junk Store itself? This section covers general plugin problems ‚Äî from install issues to launch errors and everything in between.

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>I don't have any extensions‚Äîwhat do I do?</summary>

  <p>
    If you don‚Äôt see any extensions, you‚Äôll need to generate them. Currently, Junk Store supports extensions for <strong>Epic</strong>, <strong>GOG</strong>, and <strong>Amazon</strong>.
  </p>

  <p><strong>To generate extensions:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open Junk Store and press <strong>L3 + R3</strong> to open the plugin menu.</li>
    <li>Make sure you're logged in to your Junk Store account.</li>
    <li>Scroll down to the <strong>Tools</strong> section.</li>
    <li>Open the sliders menu (‚ò∞) next to the search bar and select <strong>Download All Presets from Server</strong>.</li>
    <li>Then, go to each extension you want (Epic, GOG, Amazon) and press the <strong>Download</strong> button (üì•) for each one.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Once downloaded, the extensions will appear as tabs in Junk Store.

  <summary>My game won‚Äôt launch after a fresh install. What should I do?</summary>
  <p>
    Let‚Äôs go through a step-by-step checklist to make sure everything is set up correctly. After each step, try launching the game‚Äîthis helps identify exactly what fixed the issue (if it does).
  </p>

  <p><strong>1. Check if Epic is in offline mode</strong><br>
  Sometimes Epic being set to offline can prevent games from launching.<br>
  - Go to: <code>Junk Store &gt; Epic Tab &gt; ‚öôÔ∏è Cog Icon</code><br>
  - Make sure <strong>Offline Mode</strong> is toggled <strong>off</strong><br>
  - If you change this setting, make sure to <strong>Press X to Save</strong>
  </p>

  <p><strong>2. Install any missing game dependencies</strong><br>
  Missing or broken dependencies can cause launch issues.<br>
  - You may get prompted to install things like Microsoft C++ runtimes when first launching.
  - Easily install any missing dependencies via our built-in dependency installer (no more Proton Tricks)
  </p>

  <p><strong>3. Verify and repair the game files</strong><br>
  Corrupted or incomplete installs can be fixed with these tools.<br>
  - To verify game files:<br>
    <code>Junk Store &gt; [Your Game] &gt; ‚ò∞ Sliders Menu &gt; Verify Game</code><br>
  - To repair game files:<br>
    <code>Junk Store &gt; [Your Game] &gt; ‚ò∞ Sliders Menu &gt; Repair Game</code>
  </p>

  <p><strong>4. Change to a GE-Proton version</strong><br>
  Some games require a more compatible version of Proton.<br>
  - Go to:<br>
    <code>Junk Store &gt; [Your Game] &gt; Press Y &gt; ‚öôÔ∏è Cog Icon &gt; Compatibility</code><br>
  - Select a <strong>GE-Proton</strong> version
  </p>

  <p><strong>5. Enable the EOS Overlay</strong><br>
  Some games require the Epic Online Services (EOS) overlay to launch properly.<br>
  - Go to:<br>
    <code>Junk Store &gt; [Your Game] &gt; ‚ò∞ Sliders Menu &gt; Enable EOS Overlay</code>
  </p>
</details>

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>My game shows a rainbow screen (TV test), black screen, or fails to launch. What should I do?</summary>

  <p>
    These issues are common with non-Steam games and are often related to Proton compatibility. Junk Store defaults to the system version of Proton, but this doesn't always work well for all games.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Try using a GE-Proton version:</strong><br>
  GE-Proton tends to be more compatible with non-Steam games and often fixes these launch issues.<br>
  - To change Proton version:<br>  
    <code>Junk Store &gt; [Your Game] &gt; Press Y &gt; ‚öôÔ∏è Cog Icon &gt; Compatibility</code><br>
  - Select a <strong>GE-Proton</strong> version from the list
  </p>

  <p><strong>Where to get GE-Proton versions:</strong><br>
  - <strong>Wine Cellar</strong> (Decky Plugin)<br>
  - <strong>ProtonUp-QT</strong> from the Discover Store on your Steam Deck
  </p>

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>My games are missing or not showing up in the Epic/Amazon/GOG tab. What should I check?</summary>

  <p>
    If your games aren‚Äôt appearing in one of the store tabs, try the following checks to resolve it:
  </p>

  <p><strong>1. Check "Show Installed" isn't toggled on:</strong><br>
  - Check the bottom-right of the store tab (Epic, Amazon, or GOG)<br>
  - If <strong>Show Installed</strong> is enabled, only games already installed will be visible<br>
  - Disable this to see your full game library
  </p>

  <p><strong>2. Check the search bar:</strong><br>
  - Make sure you haven‚Äôt accidentally typed something into the search bar that‚Äôs filtering your games<br>
  - Clear the text field to show all titles
  </p>

  <p><strong>3. Check your login account:</strong><br>
  - You might be logged into a different Epic/Amazon/GOG account<br>
  - Log out and back in with the correct account linked to your game library
  </p>

  <p><strong>4. Refresh the game list:</strong><br>
  - Go to the Epic/Gog/Amazon tab and select the sliders menu to manually refresh the game list<br>
  - This can help pull in any missing titles, especially after login or token changes
  </p>

  <summary>I don‚Äôt have Proton GE or don‚Äôt know how to install it</summary>

  <p>
    To get Proton GE or other custom versions of Proton, you can use one of the following tools:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>ProtonUp-QT</strong> ‚Äî A simple app that lets you download and manage Proton versions. You can find it in the <strong>Discover Store</strong> (in Desktop Mode).</li>
    <li><strong>Wine Cellar</strong> ‚Äî A Decky plugin that works similarly to ProtonUp-QT. If you already have Decky installed for other plugins, you can install Wine Cellar directly from the <strong>Decky Plugin Store</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once installed, use either tool to download the latest <strong>GE-Proton</strong> release. After that, you‚Äôll be able to select it as a compatibility option in Junk Store.
  </p>

  <!-- <p>
    Please refer to our [Tutorials](/help/tutorials/) section to see how to change/check your Proton version if you are unsure how to do this.

<details class="faq-box">
  <summary>I want to change the FPS for a game. How do I do this in Junk Store?</summary>
  <p>
    Just like with regular Steam games, you can change the FPS cap through the Quick Access Menu (QAM).  
    Hit the <strong>three-dot button</strong> on your Deck to open the QAM, scroll to the performance tab, and adjust the FPS, TDP, refresh rate, or any other performance settings from there.
  </p>

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>I'm logged in, but no games are showing. What should I do?</summary>

  <p>
    If you're logged in but your games aren't appearing, try the following steps:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Refresh your games list</strong><br>
    Go to the main Epic/GOG/Amazon tab ‚Üí <strong>‚ò∞ Sliders Menu ‚Üí Refresh Games List</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Reboot your Steam Deck</strong><br>
    Sometimes a restart is all it takes to reload everything properly.</li>

    <li><strong>Log out and log back in</strong><br>
    From the affected storefront tab, log out and then log in again to refresh the token and game data.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>My game gets stuck at the Steam pre-launch screen. What should I do?</summary>

  <p>
    This issue might be caused by another plugin‚Äîsuch as <code>decky-cloud-save</code> or <code>syncthing</code>‚Äîlocking Junk Store‚Äôs files.
  </p>

  <p>
    Make sure nothing is interfering with the following folder:
  </p>

  <pre><code>~/.config/junkstore</code></pre>

  <p>
    Junk Store relies on this data directory to function correctly, so if another tool is syncing or locking files in that path, it can prevent games from launching.
