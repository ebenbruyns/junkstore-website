  <summary>I don't have any extensions‚Äîwhat do I do?</summary>
  <p></p>
    If you don‚Äôt see any extensions, you‚Äôll need to generate them. Currently, Junk Store supports extensions for <strong>Epic</strong>, <strong>GOG</strong>, and <strong>Amazon</strong>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>To generate extensions:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Open Junk Store by pushing <strong>Select</strong> button above the D-pad.</li>
    <li>Make sure you're logged in to your Junk Store account.</li>
    <li>Scroll down to the <strong>Tools</strong> section.</li>
    <li>Open the sliders menu (‚ò∞) next to the search bar and select <strong>Download All Presets from Server</strong>.</li>
    <li>Then, go to each extension you want (Epic, GOG, Amazon) and press the <strong>Download</strong> button (üì•) for each one.</li>
  </ol>
    Once downloaded, the extensions will appear as tabs in Junk Store.

  <summary>Junk Store isn‚Äôt working or showing errors after installation?</summary>
    <p></p>
    This might be caused by a couple of common issues:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Decky is installed</strong><br>
        Outdated versions can cause compatibility errors, such as:<br><br>
        <strong>An error occurred while rendering this content</strong><br>
        <code>Error reference: shared SteamUI_9871360_fede34d936775239</code>
        <br><br>
        Try updating Decky and see if the issue is resolved.<br><br>
        If you're still having trouble, feel free to reach out on our 
        <a href="https://discord.gg/6mRUhR6Teh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord server</a>.
      </li><br>
      <li><strong>You're using the Steam Beta branch</strong><br>
        Breakages can happen on Steam Beta due to ongoing codebase changes. We do our best to patch any issues quickly.<br><br>
        For the most stable experience, we recommend using the <strong>Stable</strong> version of Steam. The Beta branch often includes bugs or breaking changes.<br><br>
        If you do choose to stay on Steam <em>Beta</em>, we also recommend using the <em>Beta</em> version of Junk Store for better compatibility.

  <summary>My game won‚Äôt launch after a fresh install. What should I do?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Let‚Äôs go through a step-by-step checklist to make sure everything is set up correctly. After each step, try launching the game‚Äîthis helps identify exactly what fixed the issue (if it does).
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Check if Epic is in offline mode</strong></li>
    Sometimes Epic being set to offline can prevent games from launching.
    <ul>
    <li>Go to: <code>Junk Store &gt; Epic Tab &gt; ‚öôÔ∏è Cog Icon</code></li>
    <li>Make sure <strong>Offline Mode</strong> is toggled <strong>off</strong></li>
    <li>If you change this setting, make sure to <strong>Press X to Save</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  <li><strong>Install any missing game dependencies</strong></li>
    <ul>
    <li>Missing or broken dependencies can cause launch issues.</li>
    <li>You may get prompted to install things like Microsoft C++ runtimes when first launching.</li>
    <li>Easily install any missing dependencies via our built-in dependency installer (no more Proton Tricks)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  <li><strong>Verify and repair the game files</strong></li>
    Corrupted or incomplete installs can be fixed with these tools.
    <ul>
    To verify game files:<br>
    <code>Junk Store &gt; [Your Game] &gt; ‚ò∞ Sliders Menu &gt; Verify Game</code><br>
    To repair game files:<br>
    <code>Junk Store &gt; [Your Game] &gt; ‚ò∞ Sliders Menu &gt; Repair Game</code>
    </ul>
    <br>
  <li><strong>Change to a GE-Proton version</strong></li>
    Some games require a more compatible version of Proton.
    <ul>
    Go to:<br>
    <code>Junk Store &gt; [Your Game] &gt; Press Y &gt; ‚öôÔ∏è Cog Icon &gt; Compatibility</code><br>
    Select a <strong>GE-Proton</strong> version<br>
    </ul>
    <br>
  <li><strong>Enable the EOS Overlay</strong></li>
    Some games require the Epic Online Services (EOS) overlay to launch properly.
    <ul>
      Go to:<br>
      <code>Junk Store &gt; [Your Game] &gt; ‚ò∞ Sliders Menu &gt; Enable EOS Overlay</code>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</details>

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>My game shows a rainbow screen (TV test), black screen, or fails to launch. What should I do?</summary>
  <p></p>
    These issues are common with non-Steam games and are often related to Proton compatibility. Junk Store defaults to the system version of Proton, but this doesn't always work well for all games.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Try using a GE-Proton version:</strong><br>
  GE-Proton tends to be more compatible with non-Steam games and often fixes these launch issues.
    <ul>
    <li>To change Proton version:</li>  
    <code>Junk Store &gt; [Your Game] &gt; Press Y &gt; ‚öôÔ∏è Cog Icon &gt; Compatibility</code><br>
    <li>Select a <strong>GE-Proton</strong> version from the list</li>
    </ul>
  <strong>Where to get GE-Proton versions:</strong><br>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Wine Cellar</strong> (Decky Plugin)</li>
    <li><strong>ProtonUp-QT</strong> from the Discover Store on your Steam Deck</li>
    </ul>

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>My games are missing or not showing up in the Epic/Amazon/GOG tab. What should I check?</summary>
  <p></p>
    If your games aren‚Äôt appearing in one of the store tabs, try the following checks to resolve it:
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Check "Show Installed" isn't toggled on:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the bottom-right of the store tab (Epic, Amazon, or GOG)</li>
      <li>If <strong>Show Installed</strong> is enabled, only games already installed will be visible</li>
      <li>Disable this to see your full game library</li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Check the search bar:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure you haven‚Äôt accidentally typed something into the search bar that‚Äôs filtering your games</li>
      <li>Clear the text field to show all titles</li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Check your login account:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>You might be logged into a different Epic/Amazon/GOG account</li>
      <li>Log out and back in with the correct account linked to your game library</li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Refresh the game list:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the Epic/Gog/Amazon tab and select the sliders menu to manually refresh the game list</li>
      <li>This can help pull in any missing titles, especially after login or token changes</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>I don‚Äôt have Proton GE or don‚Äôt know how to install it</summary>
  <p></p>
    To get Proton GE or other custom versions of Proton, you can use one of the following tools:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ProtonUp-QT</strong> ‚Äî A simple app that lets you download and manage Proton versions. You can find it in the <strong>Discover Store</strong> (in Desktop Mode).</li>
    <li><strong>Wine Cellar</strong> ‚Äî A Decky plugin that works similarly to ProtonUp-QT. If you already have Decky installed for other plugins, you can install Wine Cellar directly from the <strong>Decky Plugin Store</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
    Once installed, use either tool to download the latest <strong>GE-Proton</strong> release. After that, you‚Äôll be able to select it as a compatibility option in Junk Store.
    <br>
    <br>
    Please refer to our <a href="{{ '/plugin_tutorials/' | relative_url }}"> Plugin Tutorials</a> page to see how to change/check your Proton version if you are unsure how to do this.

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>I'm logged in, but no games are showing. What should I do?</summary>
  <p></p>
    If you're logged in but your games aren't appearing, try the following steps:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Refresh your games list</strong><br>
    Go to the main Epic/GOG/Amazon tab ‚Üí <strong>‚ò∞ Sliders Menu ‚Üí Refresh Games List</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Reboot your Steam Deck</strong><br>
    Sometimes a restart is all it takes to reload everything properly.</li>
    <li><strong>Log out and log back in</strong><br>
    From the affected storefront tab, log out and then log in again to refresh the token and game data.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>My game gets stuck at the Steam pre-launch screen. What should I do?</summary>
  <p></p>
    This issue might be caused by another plugin‚Äîsuch as <code>decky-cloud-save</code> or <code>syncthing</code>‚Äîlocking Junk Store‚Äôs files.
  <br>
  <br>
    <strong>Make sure nothing is interfering with the following folder:</strong><br>
    <pre><code>~/.config/junkstore</code></pre>
    Junk Store relies on this data directory to function correctly, so if another tool is syncing or locking files in that path, it can prevent games from launching.

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>Having issues bringing up the keyboard in Game Mode?</summary>
  <p></p>
    If the <strong>Steam + X</strong> shortcut isn‚Äôt bringing up the keyboard try the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Try to bring up the keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è from the Quick Access Menu (<strong>‚ãØ</strong>).</li>
    <li>Tap directly on a text field (like a password box) to prompt the keyboard.</li>
    <li>Try toggling to Desktop Mode and back to Game Mode to reset input services.</li>
    <li>Restart Steam or the device if the issue persists.</li>
  </ul>
    This is a known Steam bug that has been around for a while. These steps usually help work around it until Valve fixes it in a future update.
</details>

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>Why won't my game launch?</summary>
  <p></p>
    Games may fail to launch for a variety of reasons. Here are some common causes and what you can do:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Wrong compatibility layer:</strong><br>
      Try switching to a different version of Proton. Non-Steam games usually work best with <strong>GE-Proton</strong>. We recommend finding a version that works well for most of your library and using it as the default for non-Steam games.<br><br>
      However, some titles require a <em>specific</em> version of Proton or GE-Proton to run properly.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Missing dependencies:</strong><br>
      Some games require additional libraries such as <strong>Microsoft C++ Runtime</strong> or <strong>DirectX</strong>. These dependencies may not always trigger an obvious error message, so try installing them if you suspect they‚Äôre missing.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Check ProtonDB:</strong><br>
      If the game still won‚Äôt launch, visit <a href="https://www.protondb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProtonDB.com</a> for community tips. You may find game-specific tweaks, compatibility reports, or Proton version recommendations that solve your issue.
</details>

<details class="troubleshooting-box">
  <summary>I installed a game on the new version and can't see it in the Decky one?</summary>
  <p></p>
    The new version of Junk Store uses a different system, so games installed there won‚Äôt show up in the older Decky version ‚Äî and can‚Äôt be moved over.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you‚Äôre switching back to the Decky version:
    <ul>
      <li>Back up any save files manually otherwise they will be deleted.</li>
      <li>Uninstall the game from the new version (to free up space).</li>
      <li>Reinstall the game from within the Decky version of Junk Store.</li>
      <li>Restore you game save manually.</li>
    </ul>
    Tip: Do this before your trial ends ‚Äî otherwise, you may lose access and the games will still occupy storage.
