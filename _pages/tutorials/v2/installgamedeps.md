<h2>üì¶ Installing Common Dependencies with Junk Store (No Protontricks Needed)</h2>

<p>Most games will work out of the box thanks to <strong>Visual C++ 2022 (x64)</strong>, which is installed automatically with each game. However, some games require extra dependencies like .NET or older Visual C++ redistributables for example.</p>

<p>Junk Store makes it easy to install these <strong>without using Protontricks</strong>.</p>

<h3>‚úÖ How to Install Dependencies in Junk Store</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Open the Game Page</strong><br>
    Navigate to the game inside Junk Store.</li>

  <li><strong>Click the ‚öôÔ∏è Cog Menu</strong><br>
    It's located in the top-right corner of the game page.</li>

  <li><strong>Select <code>Installation</code></strong><br>
    From the dropdown menu, choose the <code>Installation</code> tab.</li>

  <li><strong>Expand the Installation Options</strong><br>
    If you don‚Äôt see a <code>Dependencies</code> section, use the dropdown at the top (usually set to <code>Basic</code>) and change it to <code>All</code>.</li>

  <li><strong>Enable Required Dependencies</strong><br>
    Under the <code>Dependencies</code> section, you'll see a list of available components.<br>
    Toggle the one(s) you need ‚Äî the switch will turn <strong>blue</strong> when enabled.</li>

  <li><strong>Save Your Changes</strong><br>
    Press <kbd>X</kbd> to save.<br>
    If you forget, Junk Store will remind you that you have unsaved changes.<br>
    - Click <strong>Save</strong> to apply changes so the dependency installs on next game launch.<br>
    - Or click <strong>Discard</strong> to exit without saving.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you're not sure which dependency is needed, try launching the game first ‚Äî missing components usually produce a helpful error.
