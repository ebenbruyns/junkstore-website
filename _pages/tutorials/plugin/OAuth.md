### Steps for Logging in to Epic Games

This guide uses Google for logging in, but the steps are the same for other third-party methods.

1. **Switch to Desktop Mode**  
   If you don't have an external mouse and keyboard connected, you may want to download **Core Keyboard** from the Discover Store.

2. **Open Steam in Big Picture Mode**  
   Press the Steam button and switch to **Big Picture Mode**.

3. **Navigate to Epic Tab in Junk Store**  
   Go to **Junk Store** > **Games** > **Epic Tab** and select **Login**.

4. **Choose Your Login Method**  
   Once the Epic Games Login screen appears, select your login method. A browser will open for you to log in with your chosen method.

5. **Login via Google**  
   In this example, we’ll use Google. Select **Continue** when prompted.

6. **Sign In with Google**  
   Enter your Google credentials on the sign-in screen.

9. **Enter 2FA Code (If Prompted)**  
   If you’re asked, enter your two-factor authentication (2FA) code. After entering the code, you’ll be returned to **Big Picture Mode**.

10. **Exit Big Picture Mode**  
    Press the Steam button, navigate to **Power**, and select **Exit Big Picture Mode** to return to **Game Mode**.

11. **Go Back to Junk Store**  
    Once in **Game Mode**, press the three dots, go back to **Junk Store** > **Games**, and you should now be logged into your Epic account.

12. **Check Your Library**  
    Your Epic Games library should now populate. If it doesn’t, navigate down and press **Y** to select **Show All**.  
    ![Epic Library](/assets/images/OAuth/Epic%20Library%20v2.jpeg){: loading="lazy"}

    - Ensure **Show Installed** is not selected.
    - Clear any text from the search box to see all games.

    **Note:** Games requiring the EA app or Origin will not appear in your library due to lack of support from Epic/Legendary.

13. **Install a Game to Test**  
    Choose a game from your library to install. We recommend starting with a game that is known to work well on the Steam Deck.

    - Visit our <a href="/tested-games">Games Tested</a> page for a list of games that are known to work.
    - Avoid choosing a large or complex game for the first test.

    **Tip:** Some games may require additional tweaks to run properly on the Steam Deck. **Doom 64** is a great test game if you have it.  
    ![Doom 64 Install](/assets/images/OAuth/Doom%2064.jpeg){: loading="lazy"}

14. **You're Ready to Play!**  
    Once you've tested a smaller game and it works, you're good to go!
