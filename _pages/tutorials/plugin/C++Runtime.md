# If Protontricks Doesn’t Work

Some games need a special Microsoft file (called the **C++ Runtime**) to work properly.  
Normally, we'd use **Protontricks** to install this — but sometimes Protontricks doesn't do the job.

Here’s how you can install it manually. Don’t worry, it’s easy!

---

## Manual Install Steps

1. Go to the official download page:  
    [Microsoft C++ Redistributable Downloads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

2. Download this file:  
   **X64 Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022**  
   (The file name will be something like `VC_redist.x64.exe`)

3. Move the downloaded file into your game’s folder:  
   - **Epic Games** (e.g., The Callisto Protocol): *~/Games/epic/TheCallistoProtocol*
   - **GOG Games**:  *~/Games/gog/**your-game-folder***

4. Open **Junk Store** and go to the game’s page.

5. Open the **sliders menu** (press the button with the sliders icon).

6. Choose *Run EXE in game folder*.

7. Select **VC_redist.x64.exe**

8. Follow the install instructions like you would on a Windows PC.

That’s it! Once it’s done, try launching the game again — it should now work properly.

## Extra Tips If the Game Still Isn’t Working

- **Check [ProtonDB.com](https://www.protondb.com)**  
  Other players often share which Proton version works best or if extra steps are needed.

- **Try a different Proton version**  
  The default "Experimental" version can be buggy. Try using **GE-Proton** — it's more stable in many cases.

- **Game works with "Run EXE" but not the Play button?**  
  Try **resetting the launch options** in Junk Store to default.

- **Still no luck? Try a fresh start.**  
  You can **delete the game’s prefix** (basically its “Windows install environment”) from Junk Store.  
  > Be careful — this will delete all saved data and settings for that game!
