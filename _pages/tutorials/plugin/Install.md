> ‚úÖ Make sure the Epic account you log in with has games in its library, or nothing will show up.

---

### Step 5: Use Desktop Mode for Third-Party Logins

If you want to log in using **Xbox**, **PlayStation**, **Nintendo**, or another method:

- Switch to **Desktop Mode**
- Follow our guide: [Login with OAuth / Third-Party](/tutorials/plugin/OAuth)

---

### Step 6: View Your Library

- After logging in, your Epic library should load automatically
- If it doesn't:
  - Scroll down and press `Y` on **Show All**
  - Make sure **Show Installed** is not selected
  - Clear the search box if needed

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Games that need **EA App** or **Origin** won‚Äôt show up ‚Äî they aren't supported.

---

### Step 7: Test with a Small Game

To make sure everything works:

- Try installing a smaller game
- We recommend something simple like **DOOM 64**

> ‚ùó Avoid huge or complex games right away. Some games need extra setup to work properly on Steam Deck.
