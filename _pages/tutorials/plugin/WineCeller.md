## Intro

This guide assumes you've already installed **Junk Store via Decky Loader**.  
If you haven't, check out our tutorial here:

- [How to Install Junk Store](/tutorials/plugin/Install)

If you're not sure how to change the **Proton version** used for a game, refer to:

- [How to Check/Change Proton Version](/tutorials/plugin/Proton)

## What is Wine Cellar?

**Wine Cellar** is a Decky plugin that makes it super easy to download and manage different versions of Proton—without switching to desktop mode.

Yes, there are other tools like **ProtonUp-Qt**, but Wine Cellar is the most Deck-friendly option. We recommend it because it's simple, clean, and works right inside Game Mode.

## When Should I Use a Different Proton Version?

If you launch a game and it:
- Shows a black screen, then closes back to the game page
- Doesn't start at all

Then you probably need to switch your Proton version.

To find the best version for your game:
- Check [ProtonDB.com](https://www.protondb.com/)
- Or visit our known-working game lists: <a href="/tested-games">Games Tested</a>

## How to Install New Proton Versions

We recommend using **GE-Proton** versions because they support more games and fix more issues than the default versions.

### Step 1: Find Your Version
- Scroll to the **GE-Proton** version you want
- Move to the **three dots**, then press `A`
