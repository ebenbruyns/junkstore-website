This guide shows you how to check or change the **Proton version** used for a game, using the **Junk-Store** and **Wine Cellar** plugins via Decky Loader.

It assumes:
- Youâ€™ve already installed **Junk-Store**
- Youâ€™ve installed **Wine Cellar**
- Youâ€™ve got at least one extra version of Proton installed

If not, start here first:

## Why Change Proton Versions?

Some games just donâ€™t work with the default Proton version.  
If your game:
- Opens to a black screen then closes
- Crashes or wonâ€™t start

It might need a different Proton version.

> ðŸ’¡ Weâ€™ve had the most success with **GE-Proton 9-7** and **GE-Proton 9-20**.

## How Junk-Store Handles Proton

Junk-Store installs each game in its own prefix (kind of like its own folder with settings), so you can set a **different Proton version per game**.  
The setting stays savedâ€”even after reboot.

## Alternative Method: From Steam Library

You can also check or change Proton versions straight from the **Steam Library**.

### Step 1: Open Library Game Menu
From your game list, highlight the game and press the **Start/Options button** (the one with three lines).

This opens a quick menu.
