Looking to play Ubisoft games on your Steam Deck through Junk Store? While some Ubisoft titles are available through Epic Games Store integration, others require manual Ubisoft Connect installation. This comprehensive guide covers both scenarios and compatibility expectations.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Ubisoft games have **mixed support** through Junk Store. Some titles appear in Epic Games Store and work well, while others may require additional setup or may not work at all. This tutorial covers the manual installation process for Ubisoft Connect.
